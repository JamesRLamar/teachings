# The Biggest Loser

>“Then Jesus told his disciples, ‘If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?’” (Matthew 16:24–26)

We live in a world obsessed with not losing status, comfort, and control. But Jesus says the only way to truly win is to lose for His sake. The gospel flips the scoreboard: surrender is victory; self is failure.

### My Girl's First 5Ks

My oldest daughter, Maddie, was nine when she tasted the high of finishing something hard. I ran beside her as she faithfully trucked along. But near the end, she began to sputter.  

“Finish strong, Maddie!” I urged. “You started this race, now finish it!”

Before the words had even left my mouth, she surged ahead, flying past me like a bird set free. I laughed to myself, _Wow, that kid can move._ I couldn’t have been prouder.

I wanted to teach my girls to “embrace the suck,” as I had taught myself as a young man. That mindset had given me a relentless confidence, and I longed to pass it on to them.

Some years later, it was Maci’s turn. It was another sweltering day in Lafayette, Louisiana—not exactly a runner’s dream. Maci was seven, sweet and innocent, but untested. She groaned at the thought of sweating, which made me chuckle. Still, I coaxed her, “Let’s just put our shoes on and step out onto the pavement.”

Once outside, I paused and asked, “How do you feel right now? Was that hard? Do you think you’re ready to walk with me?” She nodded, a little annoyed by the obviousness of the question, but also amused at my trick for getting her outdoors.

We began with a light walk, taking in the ancient live oaks and the mallard ducks resting by our neighborhood lake. We looped around both ponds until our bodies felt primed. Then I leaned over and asked, “How about now? Think you can jog a little?”  

She smiled and nodded again, surprised at her own readiness.

We jogged. Minute by minute, it grew tougher. Sweat trickled, then poured. Maci wanted to quit, but Maddie and I encouraged her: “Just a little more. Let’s jog to the end of this stretch.” Then again: “Let’s make it to that tree.” We cheered her on with gentle praise and steady nudges.

Just as she began to find her rhythm, the skies opened. Rain poured, mud splashed, every reason her former self would have needed to quit. But something new had taken root—resilience. She whimpered as her legs ached and her mind begged her to stop. But we were near the end; this was no time to surrender.

Maddie, remembering her own lesson, shouted the words I once gave her: _“Finish strong!”_  
“You’ve come this far, not to give up, but to finish faster than you started. Now go!”

Maci’s little feet pounded the pavement with power. Her pace quickened to a roar, and she crossed the line like a chariot of fire. I snapped a photo of us three, drenched in sweat and rain, faces lit with joy. The look on Maci’s face was pure fury and victory.

That’s what it means to finish strong.

You didn’t become a Christian to finish weaker, but stronger.

**Question**: What are you still trying to “save” that Jesus is asking you to lose?

### 1. Matthew 16:24–26 — Lose to Truly Live
> Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?”

**Teaching Point:**
Jesus calls us to a decisive surrender: lay down self-rule to find real life in Him. Trying to clutch life on our terms guarantees loss; losing life for His name guarantees life.

**Question(s):**
What does it mean to "save" your life?
What does it mean to "lose" your life?

### 2. Philippians 3:7–8, 12–14 — The Gain of Loss, The Grit to Press On
> But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ…  
> Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me. Brethren… one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

**Teaching Point:**
The Christian life isn’t coasting—it’s pressing. We surrender our past trophies and present comforts to pursue a Person.

**Question(s):**
Paul re-labels his ledger: Paul calls all earthly “wins” losses compared to what? 
What does it mean to re-label our “losses”?

### 3. 1 Corinthians 9:24–27 — Run to Win
> Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it. And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable crown. Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air. But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified.

> Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. (Hebrews 12:1–2)

**Teaching Point:**
Grace deserves grit. We don’t meander; we train. Spiritual discipline is not legalism—it’s love with a finish line in view. You didn’t become a Christian to finish weaker, but stronger.

**Question:**
What kind of weights or habits can sabotage our race?

### 4. Luke 9:23 — Pick Up Your Cross Daily
> Then He said to them all, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me."

>"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me." (Galatians 2:20)

**Teaching Point:**
The cross isn't a one-time decision—it's a daily surrender. Every morning, we choose to die to self and live for Christ. The "daily" part is what separates true disciples from fair-weather followers.

**Question:**
What does "taking up your cross daily" look like?
