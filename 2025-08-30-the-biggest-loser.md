# The Biggest Loser

## Key Verse
Matthew 16:24–26 (NKJV)  
“Then Jesus told his disciples, ‘If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?’”

## Opening Thought
We live in a world obsessed with not losing—status, comfort, control. But Jesus says the only way to truly win is to lose for His sake. The gospel flips the scoreboard: surrender is victory; self is failure.

Illustration: First 5Ks with my girls  
My oldest, Maddie, was nine when she first tasted the joy of finishing something hard. As she sputtered near the end, I urged, “Finish strong, Maddie!” She exploded forward like a bird set free. Years later, it was seven-year-old Maci’s turn—sweltering Louisiana heat, rain pouring, mud splashing, every reason to quit. But encouragement, small goals, and a fierce resolve carried her. Near the end, Maddie echoed my words to her: “Finish strong!” Maci’s pace turned to fire. She crossed the line—drenched, fierce, victorious. That’s what it means to finish strong. 

You didn’t become a Christian to finish weaker, but stronger.

Question: What are you still trying to “save” that Jesus is asking you to lose?

### 1. Matthew 16:24–26 — Lose to Truly Live
> Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?”

Teaching Point:
Jesus calls us to a decisive surrender: lay down self-rule to find real life in Him. Trying to clutch life on our terms guarantees loss; losing life for His name guarantees life.

Question(s):
What does it mean to "save" your life?
What does it mean to "lose" your life?

### 2. Philippians 3:7–8, 12–14 — The Gain of Loss, The Grit to Press On
> But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ…  
> Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me. Brethren… one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

Teaching Point:
The Christian life isn’t coasting—it’s pressing. We surrender our past trophies and present comforts to pursue a Person.

Question:
Paul re-labels his ledger: Paul calls all earthly “wins” losses compared to what? 
What “gains” do you need to re-label as “losses” to know Christ more?

### 3. 1 Corinthians 9:24–27 — Run to Win
> Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it. And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable crown. Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air. But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified.

> Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. (Hebrews 12:1–2)

Teaching Point:
Grace deserves grit. We don’t meander; we train. Spiritual discipline is not legalism—it’s love with a finish line in view. You didn’t become a Christian to finish weaker, but stronger.

Question:
What weights, habits, or comforts are sabotaging your race?

### 4. Luke 9:23 — Pick Up Your Cross Daily
> Then He said to them all, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me."

>"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me." (Galatians 2:20)

Teaching Point:
The cross isn't a one-time decision—it's a daily surrender. Every morning, we choose to die to self and live for Christ. The "daily" part is what separates true disciples from fair-weather followers.

Question:
What does "taking up your cross daily" look like in your life right now?


## Closing Encouragement
In Jesus’ kingdom, the biggest loser is the true winner. Lose your life for His sake—your control, your self-made identity, your comfort—and you will find a life you could never manufacture: forgiven, focused, fueled by joy. Like Maddie and Maci, the Father runs beside you, urging, “Finish strong!” Take the next faithful step. Fix your eyes on Jesus. You started this race by grace—now finish it stronger than you began.

## Closing Reflection Questions
- What do you still seek that you should be surrendering?
- What do you have left to lose that is sabotaging your love for Jesus?
- Are you running stronger now than when you first began?
- What does finishing strong look like for you?
