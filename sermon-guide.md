# 📖 **Sermon Template: Teaching + Companion Guide**


## **Title**

*Write a concise, memorable theme here.*



## **Key Verse**

*Write out the verse in full (not just the reference).*

**Note:** Scripture should be quoted in NKJV unless otherwise noted.



## **Opening Thought**

* Short introduction that sets the stage for the theme.
* Place the topic in the sweep of God’s story (creation → Christ → Spirit → new creation).
* Connect it immediately to the heart.

**Question:** *One compelling question that gets people thinking right away.*



## **Flow (Repeat for Each Passage or Point)**

### **1. \[Scripture Reference & Title]**

> *(Print the scripture text in full here in NKJV unless otherwise noted.)*

**Teaching Point:**

* One sentence explaining what this text teaches about the theme.

**Question:**

* A single probing question that draws out the meaning from the passage.

**Goal:**
Short, focused questions tied directly to the passage being read. They are like “shovel questions” — they help the group dig into the text and uncover meaning.

**Purpose:**

* Keep people engaged with the Scripture.
* Draw out what the Bible says before rushing to application.
* Plant truth in the heart by letting the text do the teaching.

**Examples:**

* *“What does it reveal about God’s heart that He chose to come close in flesh, not just in power?”* (John 1:14)
* *“How does the promise of ‘God Himself will be with them’ change your picture of heaven?”* (Revelation 21:3)

**Tips for Teachers:**

* Ask just **one seed question per passage.**
* Keep them simple, clear, and text-centered.
* Don’t answer it yourself right away — let the group wrestle with it.
* Think of them as “meaning extractors,” not life-application yet.


## **Closing**

*Summarize the big idea in a brief, encouraging way.*
*Connect back to your opening illustration if possible.*


## **Closing Reflection Questions**

**Goal:**
Broader, heart-level questions that zoom out from the Scriptures studied to personal life. They invite people to examine their own desires, habits, and responses to God.

**Purpose:**

* Move from *“What does the Bible say?”* to *“How will I live this out?”*
* Allow space for the Spirit to convict, comfort, and guide.
* Build bridges between eternal truth and everyday life.

**Examples:**

* *“Do you want to dwell with God more than anything else?”*
* *“When you think of heaven, do you picture streets of gold — or the face of God?”*
* *“What habits, thoughts, or desires might make the Spirit feel unwelcome in your life?”*

**Tips for Teachers:**

* Save these for the **end of the teaching** so the group has the full picture first.
* Use them to spark **self-examination, not debate.**
* Expect silence at first — deep reflection takes time.
* These are often rhetorical.


## **Teaching Reminders (for the Teacher)**

* **Slow down** and let the truth confront you first.
* Keep circling back to the **single theme**.
* Let each passage show **a step in the story**.
* Use **questions during teaching** to plant meaning.
* Save **reflection questions for the end** to invite transformation.
