## Prepare Yourself

>"Preach all your sermons over to yourself. Remember that your own heart must ever be your first congregation. Take for yourself, that you may know if it be digestible, some of the food which you are preparing for others."
>— Meyer, F. B.. Jottings And Hints To Lay Preachers

Prepare yourself before you prepare your message. If this word does not disturb you, it will not disturb others. If you are not moved, do not expect a change from others. You cannot give away what you do not have. This is where power and conviction come from. You may fail at all else, but do not fail to live the word you teach.

>"You don't have to advertise a fire." — Leonard Ravenhill

Set yourself on fire. Let your heart be set ablaze with passion for Him and brokenness for sin, and He will use your ashes to fertilize the garden of souls lost in this world.

## Develop One Main Thought

>"There is all the difference possible between delivering a sermon and uttering a message." 

Seek first, not to deliver a sermon, but to utter a divine message. You won't always feel the breath of heaven on your words, but you can always live and love the word you teach. Prepare well, but always keep your heart open for the spontaneous and Spirit-led "logos."

>"We have no right to deliver the divine thought in a slipshod or slovenly manner. The apple of gold must be set in the frame of silver. The King’s words must be engrossed on parchment or vellum. There must be a full use of every method which would enhance to others the sense of the glory and claims of Him for whom we speak." 

>"The longer I live, and study the effect of sermons and speeches, the more sure I am that it is a profound mistake to introduce too many divergent themes, any one of which is useful and interesting, but none stands out with such marked prominence and distinctness as to arrest the attention of the congregation."

>"He is a successful preacher of the highest order who manages to present one great conception before his people each time he addresses them, so that, as they break from the spell of his influence, they may be possessed by one thought, inspired by one motive, and compelled towards one act."
>— Meyer, F. B.. Jottings And Hints To Lay Preachers

Your message ought to be centered around one central point, so fine, it may be driven like a sharp wedge through a stubborn log. This one main thought is your golden apple. 

>“A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.” (Proverbs 25:11)

When you teach, you must bring a wedge, not an ax. A wedge drives home one point, not several. Using a wedge is the difference between efficiently splitting a log versus hacking at it over and over. I find the sharp shooter's mantra fitting here as well, "Aim small, miss small."

## Quote One Key Verse

Quote the most key verse. This can be repeated later, but this verse best encapsulates your teaching or is the foundation of all other points. Quoting this early will prime the readers and center this time around God's Word, not your own.

## Tell One Opening Illustration or Story

Once you have brought the apple of gold center stage, it's time to frame it amidst settings of silver. An opening story or illustration will help others to visualize each point. The remaining settings of silver will each expound upon the beauty of the golden apple. Each verse or teaching point draws us in closer. We see our reflection in the finely polished surface. We feel the warmth of the sun that shines upon it. We smell its fragrance and taste its divine goodness. We honor its power to condemn sin, but also to forgive it.

You may continue coming back to this opening story or illustration to reinforce each principle. This may reach deep in the heart, but it doesn't have to be dramatic if it's simple and visual. However, you begin, let this moment become strikingly real and tangible, the physical substance of an otherwise ethereal concept.

## Ask One Compelling Question

Ask one compelling question that strikes at both the heart of the message and the heart of the listener. This question should ring loud and true, and by now, your words ought to have enough impact that you may say, "Amen" and walk away. If you have lived this one word and wrestled with it as Jacob wrestled with God, then your conscience may be clear that you are a workman approved. 

Anything else said beyond this should only add the most subtle of craftsmanship and refinement to what is already a word aptly spoken. Less is more. The seed has been planted. Do not overwater.

## Add One or More Supporting Points

### Scripture

It's helpful once you have your one main thought, to gather as many relevant verses as possible around the subject and study each. You may want to quote them all, and certainly reading Scripture is to be encouraged, but narrow the list to the most potent and pointed verses to support your theme.
### Teaching Point:

One sentence explaining what this text teaches about the theme.
### Dialog Question:

Ask a probing question or two that draws out the meaning of the passage. The goal is to create dialogue that forces others to wrestle with the concept and peal back the layers of meaning. Extracting practical examples is generally a good idea as well, in particular for your last point which leads into the closing and reflection.

## Close Your One Thought

Summarize the big idea and connect back to your opening illustration or story if possible.

### Ask Reflective Questions

The goal of these questions is to move from “What does the Bible say?” to “How will I live this?” Allow space and silence for the Spirit to convict, comfort, and guide. A good rule of thumb in knowing how long to be silent is to here yourself answer the question before moving along. ending wiht still reflection is good if you've done well at driving home one concept that has now planted itself deep within their conscience.
