title: Family Devotion Choice of the Two Cups
---


**There are two cups to choose from:**
1. The Cup of Life that brings blessing, but tastes unpleasant at first
2. The Cup of Sin that brings sickness, but tastes pleasant

**The Cup of Sin**

- Choosing to lie to protect yourself
- Choosing to take without asking permission
- Choosing to feed anger until it becomes hate
- Choosing to serve yourself and worship yourself like you were God

**The Cup of Life**

- Choosing to tell the truth
- Choosing to not take from others without asking permission
- Choosing to feed forgiveness not anger
- Choosing to treat others better than yourself
- Choosing to worship Yahweh and serve no one else

**Deuteronomy 30 (Paraphrase)**

1 All these blessings and curses I have spoken about will happen. Take them to heart.

2 If you and your children return to Yahweh your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, doing everything I command you today, He will restore you and have mercy on you.

6 Yahweh your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants. You will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and you will live.

7 Then Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies instead so they will fear you as Egypt did.

9 Yahweh your God will give you many blessings in everything you do: You will have many children. Your cows will have many calves. Your soil will produce many crops.

10 God will delight in making you as prosperous if you obey Him and follow His Commandments and return to Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

11 God's Commandments aren't too hard for you or impossible to keep.

12 They are not in heaven so that you have to go looking for them and wonder what they mean.

14 No, these Words are very close to you. They’re in your mind and in your heart so that you can obey them.

15 Today I offer you life and blessing or death and sickness.

16 This is what I’m commanding you: Love Yahweh your God, obey His Commands. Then you will live and Yahweh your God will bless you.

19 Heaven and earth are watching you today and see that I have offered you life or death, blessings or curses. Choose life so that you will live.

20 Love Yahweh your God, obey him, and be loyal to him. This will be your way of life. This is the way to life.
