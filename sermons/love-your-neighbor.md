Love Your Neighbor
## Scripture

**Leviticus 19:17-18**
You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall surely rebuke your neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.  You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.

**Matthew 5:43-45**
You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.

**Matthew 5:46-48**
For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

**John 13:34-35**
A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.

**1 John 3:14**
We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. The one not loving his brother stays in death.

## Why do we Love our Neighbor?

### 1. It is Commanded

- God himself, in both the Old and New Testaments, makes it clear that we are to love our neighbor. This isn't optional; it's a divine mandate that comes straight from the heart of God.

### 2. It is Expected

- Jesus took this command a step further by demonstrating what it looks like to love one's neighbor, from washing feet to healing the sick. When we say we are followers of Jesus, the expectation is that we emulate His actions.

### 3. It Fosters Life

- Loving your neighbor isn't just good for your neighbor; its good for your soul. It builds stronger communities, encourages empathy, and breaks down barriers of hostility or prejudice.

### 4. It is a Sign that We are His People

- Loving your neighbor is the litmus test that reveals the genuineness of our faith.

## How do we Love our Neighbor?

### 1. By being Consistently Candid but Kindly Confrontational

What are some ways we can be candid relationally? 
- **Honest Communication**: Express your feelings and thoughts clearly but with grace. Make sure your words build up, rather than tear down.

What are some ways we can be candid spiritually? 
- **Confident Evangelism**: Be bold in sharing your story. Refuse to let fear hold you back from telling others who God is, casting vision for relationship and righteousness, joyfully tell of the wonders God has done in your life. 

### 2. By returning Blessing for Cursing

What can this look like day-to-day?
- **Killer Kindness**: Imagine a situation where a neighbor wrongs you, either by slander or some form of betrayal. Instead of retaliating, how can you show a random or even anonymous act of kindness?

### 3. By Connecting with People through our Passions

- **Outdoor Movie Nights**: Set up a projector in your yard and invite neighbors for an outdoor movie night.
- **Skill-Sharing Workshops**: If you have a particular skill—like woodworking, freeze-drying food, or yoga—host a small, informal workshop or offer free coaching in your skill.
- **Community Garden**: Invite neighbors to contribute to a shared garden. This fosters a sense of shared responsibility and accomplishment.
- **Sports Day**: Organize a sports day filled with a family-friendly game. Make it a regular thing and give away a trophy that each winner must return the next event.
- **Neighborhood BBQ**: Invite your neighbors and cook for them, no strings attached.
- **Sabbath Evening Dinner**: If you've made a good connection, invite them to share a Sabbath Evening dinner on Friday night. Make it special and include just a few elements of prayer and thanks that plant seeds.

## Conclusion

It's important to remember that to love one's neighbor doesn't mean we always have to agree with them, but it does mean we see them through the eyes of Christ. By so doing, we become agents of God's love, drawing those around us to the heart of the Father. The ultimate question is, **"If we don't love our neighbors as ourselves, how well are we embodying the teachings of Jesus?"**
