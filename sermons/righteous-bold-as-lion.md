**The chapter is after King David finally has taken the throne of Israel and is now rightfully ruling.**

**2 Samuel 10 ERV**

Later King Nahash of the Ammonites died. His son Hanun became the new king after him. David said, “Nahash was kind to me, so I will be kind to his son Hanun.” So David sent his officers to comfort Hanun about his father’s death. David’s officers went to the land of the Ammonites.

**The Ammonites were descendants of the Nephalim, many of who were still giants**

But the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, their lord, “Do you think that David is trying to honor your father by sending some men to comfort you? No, David sent these men to spy on your city. They plan to make war against you.” So Hanun took David’s officers and shaved off one half of their beards. He cut off their clothes at the hips. Then he sent them away.

**Has anyone ever done something mean to you after you tried to show them kindness?**

The Ammonites saw that they had become David’s enemies, so they hired Arameans from Beth Rehob and Zobah. There were 20,000 Aramean foot soldiers. The Ammonites also hired the king of Maacah with 1000 men and 12,000 men from Tob.

**Sometimes people are just testing us. Sometimes Satan tests us. But we will see that if we resist the devil and those that follow him, they will FLEE before us!**

David heard about this, so he sent Joab and the whole army of powerful men. The Ammonites came out and got ready for the battle. They stood at the city gate. Joab saw that there were enemies in front of him and behind him. So he chose some of the best Israelite soldiers and lined them up for battle against the Arameans. Then Joab gave the other men to his brother Abishai to lead against the Ammonites.

**Have you ever felt trapped? Have you ever felt scared because someone intimidated you?**

Joab said to Abishai, “Be strong, and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God. The Lord will do what he decides is right.”

**Joab and the armies of God were surrounded and outnumbered, but they were bold and ready to fight. They trusted God and had confidence in being judged on the battlefield because they knew they were right before God**

**Pause the story and read Proverbs 28:1**

"The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion.”

**What do you think is about to happen since Joab is both righteous and bold?**

Then Joab and his men attacked the Arameans. The Arameans ran away from Joab and his men. The Ammonites saw that the Arameans were running away, so they ran away from Abishai and went back to their city. When David heard about this, he gathered all the Israelites together. They crossed over the Jordan River and went to Helam.

There the Arameans prepared for battle and attacked, but David defeated them, and they ran from the Israelites. David killed 700 chariot drivers and 40,000 horse soldiers as well as Shobach, the captain of the Aramean army. The kings who served Hadadezer saw that the Israelites had defeated them, so they made peace with the Israelites and became their servants. The Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites again.

**If we want to be bold and confident, then we have to walk in righteousness. If we are just like the world, when trouble comes we will be as fearful as they are. We will wonder if God is with us. But if we walk with God every day, then when trouble comes and Satan decides to test us, we will be bold and we will be ready. And then we will see Satan run from us like a whipped dog!**

Do you want to be bold?

Do you want to be righteous?

Do you want to walk with God?

Is there anything keeping you from being those things today?
