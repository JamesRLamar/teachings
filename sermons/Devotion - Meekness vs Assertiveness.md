**Matthew 5:5**
Blessed are the meek,
For they shall inherit the earth.

Meekness can be used in either a positive or negative way. When use positively, meekness means to be powerful yet quiet. When used negatively, meekness means to be easily imposed upon.

1 - Meekness is not weakness.

Yeshua was meek in the positive sense.

Regarding the future moment when Yeshua would be killed, He says in John:

**John 10:17-18**

Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again...

And yet the Scripture also says in Isaiah:

**Isaiah 53:7**
He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
Yet He opened not His mouth;
He was led as a lamb to the slaughter,
And as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
So He opened not His mouth.

And on the Cross, Yeshua said, in Luke:

**Luke 23:34**
Then Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.'

Yeshua was powerful, yet quiet.

But was Yeshua quiet in all things or only His personal suffering?

When did Yeshua speak up? He was never afraid to call out sin

John 4:16-18

He told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.” “I have no husband,” she replied. Jesus said to her, “You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.”

Matthew 12:34

You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

Mark 12:34

Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”

**Ephesians 4:15**

but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ

2 - Being nice can be a vice

Sometimes people pleasers are just liars. Why so?

Because people who are eager to please others often withhold the truth in order not to offend.

Being assertive means showing respect for both yourself and others. It means speaking the truth in love.

**Deuteronomy 5:20**
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

"To bear" something is to allow it to persist or even to carry it around.

So how do we balance being meek with being honest and assertive?
