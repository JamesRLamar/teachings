# Equipped for Love


>"And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers. Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. 
>
>Now all who believed were together, and had all things in common, and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as anyone had need.
>
>So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved."
>
(Acts 2:42–47)

> "And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ..." 
> 
> "but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ—from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love." 
> 
> (Ephesians 4:11-12, 15-16)

We gather as a simple house church around the principles of Acts 2:42—devoting ourselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer. But here's the beautiful truth: we're not just gathering to consume spiritual food. We're gathering to be equipped for something far greater—the work of ministry that flows from a heart cultivated in the love of God.

## The Gardenless Garden

Picture a garden where every plant is perfectly positioned, the soil is rich, and the irrigation system is flawless. The structure is there. The framework is solid. But if no one tends to the individual plants—watering them, pruning them, nurturing their growth—what happens? The structure remains, but the garden produces no fruit.

Our house church is like that garden. We have the beautiful structure of Acts 2:42-47. We gather, we study, we fellowship, we pray. But here's the question that will determine everything: 

**Are you taking ownership of cultivating the love of God in your own heart?**

### 1. The Purpose of Our Gathering

> "And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ." (Ephesians 4:11-12)

**Teaching Point:**
Our gatherings exist not just for our own spiritual consumption, but to equip each of us for the work of ministry that builds up the body of Christ.

**Question:**
What does it reveal about God's heart that He designed our church gatherings specifically to equip us for ministry rather than just to make us feel good?

### 2. The Foundation of Faith and Love

> "By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another." (John 13:35)

> "Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers." (Ephesians 1:15)

> "We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other." (2 Thessalonians 1:3)

**Teaching Point:**
Faith and love are the two qualities that Paul consistently praised and that Jesus said would mark His disciples—and they must be visible in our daily lives through concrete acts of service and devotion.

**Question:**
What does faith and love look like?

**What does faith and love look like?**

Faith and love aren't abstract concepts—they're lived out in the everyday moments of our lives. Here's what they look like:

**In our relationships:**
- Someone starts leading a weekly Bible study with a coworker
- Someone serves another member of the church by helping them with a chore, bringing them food when they're sick, visiting them at the hospital, or going to a doctor visit with them
- Inviting others over to your house or out to eat
- Calling and praying for someone or sending them a voice prayer

**In our spiritual disciplines:**
- Fasting for people in the church or your community
- Planning a ministry service like feeding the police station, gathering food to bring to community food share, or handing out water on the street
- Being set free from addiction to worldly things and choosing Jesus
- Life change and passion for Jesus that can be seen and noticed

**In our church family:**
- Watching someone's child during a gathering
- Cooking food for the gathering
- Planning a fellowship night of just food and fun

**In our children and community:**
- Children choosing to worship or pray on their own
- Being light so that students and teachers notice
- Loving the unpopular kids, being kind to other kids
- Showing love and respect for your parents and teachers

## Closing

Each of us must take responsibility for cultivating the love of God in our own hearts. 

When we do, something extraordinary happens. We begin to see ministry opportunities everywhere.

The structure provides the foundation, but faith and love are the fruit that transforms everything.

- Does your life show the kind of faith and love we discussed?
- What would it look like for you to take ownership of cultivating God's love in your heart this week?
- How can you build up the body every week?
