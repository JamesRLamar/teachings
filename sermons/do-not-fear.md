title: Do Not Fear
---


In times when we feel fear or mounting stress we need to use truth like a weapon

**1 - God will help you**
**
**
**Isaiah 41:10**

Fear not, for I am with you; Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.

"Fear not" - be irreverent, show no respect

"with you" - I am beside you facing what you face

"Be not dismayed" - be disrespectful as not to even acknowledge by looking

"strengthen" - to fortify, strength, make bold, inspire courage

"help" - to bring aid in desperate times, but this particular usage is in the past tense

"Uphold" - to support and make steady, **Exodus 17:12**

**Exodus 17:12**

But Mosesâ€™ hands became heavy; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

**2 - God will protect you**

**Psalm 121:5**
The Lord is your keeper;
The Lord is your shade at your right hand.

Elohim Shomri - God is my Protector

**Be, don't just behave:**

- Be content
- Be still
- Be loved
- Be strong and courageous

**3 - God is with you and God is for you**
**
**
**Deuteronomy 31:6**

Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.

**What things do you fear?**

**How has fear affected the following:**

- Your time?
- Your energy?
- Your relationships?
- Your health?

**Where does your faith need to grow?**
