**Scripture Reading: Deuteronomy 6:4-9**
4. Listen, people of Israel! Yahweh is our God. Yahweh is the only God. 
5. You must love Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. 
6. Always remember these commands that I give you today. 
7. Be sure to teach them to your children. Talk about these commands when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road. Talk about them when you lie down and when you get up. 
8. Tie them on your hands and wear them on your foreheads to help you remember my teachings. 
9. Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.

**Introduction:**
Hey kids! Today we're going to talk about a big and special love. It's about loving God with everything we have, just like the Bible tells us to! Imagine if you loved something so much you wanted to tell everyone about it and keep it with you all the time. That's how we can love God!

**1. Loving God with Our Whole Heart, Soul, and Strength**

**A. With All Your Heart:**
Your heart is your feelings and desires. Think about something you desire a lot. Now, imagine desiring God even more than that! Loving God means putting Him first in our hearts and thinking about Him all the time. How can you can show God you love Him today with your heart and desires?

**B. With All Your Soul:**
Your soul is your mind and it includes all the thoughts you think, both out loud and in your mind. Loving God with all your soul means that everything you think and say shows God you love Him. How can you show love to God by your words and your thoughts?

**C. With All Your Strength:**
Your strength includes your abilities and talents. It includes the things you are good at. Loving God with all our strength means devoting the things we do to Him. What can you do to use your strength and energy to help others in a way that makes God smile?

**2. Other Ways We Love God With Our Strength**

**A. With All Your Talents:**
God made you special and gave you talents like singing, drawing, or being a good friend by listening.  Do you think it shows love to God when we love others? How can you use your special talents to make others feel loved?

**B. With All Your Dreams:**
What do you want to be when you grow up? God wants us to follow our dreams and do good with our lives. We follow our dreams because they make us happy. How can you make sure your dreams make God happy too?

**C. With All Your Time:**
Time is like a big treasure chest. Are you spending it playing, helping others, or being with your family? How can you spend more time with God and learn about Him?

**3. How Do We Keep Our Love for God Strong and Safe?**

**The Love Garden**

Imagine your love for God as a garden. A special garden filled with bright and beautiful flowers, delicious fruits, and tall, strong trees. This garden is unlike any other because it grows with love!

**1. Heart Flowers:**
In the center of the garden, there's a big heart-shaped flower bed. These flowers are bright and happy. When we love God with all our desires, the flowers bloom and spread their sweet fragrance everywhere. If we stop loving, they start to wilt. How can we water our heart flowers every day?

**2. Soul Fruit:**
Scattered throughout the garden, there are fruit trees filled with tasty and nutritious fruits. These are the fruits of our mind and thoughts. When we love God with all our soul, the fruit trees are heavy with delicious fruits. How can we nourish our soul fruit with the words we speak and the thoughts we think?

**3. Strength Trees:**
On the sides of the garden, there are tall and strong trees. These trees are our strength. They grow tall and provide shade to everyone who comes near. When we love God with all our talents and strength, the trees grow taller and more robust. How can we take care of our strength fruits by using our energy and abilities to serve God and others?

**4. Guarded Gates:**
The garden has beautiful gates guarded by friendly angels. They keep the bad things out and let the good things in. How can we help the angels guard our Love Garden by keeping our trust in God and keeping our hearts pure?

So kids, every day, think of your Love Garden. Water your heart flowers, nourish your soul fruit, protect your strength trees, and help the angels guard the gates. That way, your Love Garden will always be the most beautiful place, filled with love for God, and you'll never forget to love Him with everything you have!
