>“You can lead a horse to water, but can't make it drink.” 

It's a common saying, often used to describe the limits of influence. But that phrase can feel like a cold excuse when it comes to the spiritual lives of those we love, especially our children or those in our care. Can’t more be done? Shouldn’t we try everything to lead those in darkness into the light?

No weight feels heavier than watching your child turn away from Christ—or never come to Him at all. Parents carry that grief like a wound. And as pastors and spiritual leaders, we bear a similar burden. We long for others to desire Jesus, but often, when we press in, they pull away.

Years ago, God gave my wife and me a phrase that has guided our ministry and parenting: _“Focus on the hungry.”_ It reminds us not to waste energy trying to force-feed those who aren't ready but instead to nurture those whose hearts are open. Yet even then, I sometimes wonder: What about the ones who aren't hungry? What then?

Hunger can’t be manufactured—but it _can_ be prayed for. And often, when we pray for God to stir spiritual appetite, He answers in painful ways. He leads loved ones into wilderness places—seasons of loneliness, loss, or disillusionment. These are the crucibles where hunger is born.

The Bible tells us that after forty days in the wilderness, Jesus was hungry (Matthew 4:1–2). The Spirit _led_ Him there. And if the Son of God needed wilderness to prepare for His ministry, should we expect anything less for those we love?

Don’t be afraid when God leads someone into a desert. Don’t rush to relieve the discomfort He may be using to awaken them. Focus on the hungry. But for the hard-hearted—pray for wilderness. Because that may be all that stands between freedom and fire.
