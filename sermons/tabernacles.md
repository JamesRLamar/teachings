### Introduction 

- **Attention-Getter**: Start with a small table display featuring a Halloween mask, a Christmas ornament, and items representing the Feast of Tabernacles like a small sukkah or palm branches.
    - "Take a look at these items. What do they all have in common?"
- **Challenging Question**: "Why do we make some holidays special but overlook others that are even more important in the Bible?"
- **Objective**: "Today, we're going to delve into the Feast of Tabernacles, why it matters, and what it teaches us about God's love and Yeshua's life."

1. **What is the Feast of Tabernacles?**
    - **Explanation**: 
        - Discuss the historical roots of Sukkot. Explain that it was a time to remember the Israelites' 40-year journey through the wilderness and how God protected them.
        - Talk about its agricultural significance as a harvest festival, thanking God for the abundance.
    - **Leviticus 23:33-36** ERV:  
    - Again the Lord said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites: On the 15th day of the seventh month is the Festival of Shelters. This festival to the Lord will continue for seven days. There will be a holy meeting on the first day. You must not do any work. You will bring offerings as gifts to the Lord for seven days. On the eighth day, you will have another holy meeting. You must not do any work. You will bring an offering as a gift to the Lord.
    - **Leviticus 23:41-43** ERV:  
    - You will celebrate this festival to the Lord for seven days each year. This law will continue forever. You will celebrate this festival in the seventh month. You will live in temporary shelters for seven days. All the people born in Israel will live in them. Why? So all your descendants will know that I made the Israelites live in temporary shelters during the time I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
    - **Interactive Moment**: Show a slideshow of sukkahs from different cultures and parts of the world.
    - **Challenging Question**: "If God specifically asks us to remember this feast, what might we miss about Him if we overlook it?"

2. **Yeshua and Dwelling Among Us**
    - **Explanation**: 
        - The Bible says that when Jesus was born, He tabernacled among us. 
    - **Scriptural Proof**: Read John 1:14
    - **Discussion Time**: "What does it mean that 'The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us'?"

3. **Our Bodies as Temporary Tents**
	- **Explanation**: 
	    - Introduce the concept by discussing how Paul often uses the metaphor of a tent to describe our earthly bodies. Mention that just like a tent, our bodies are not our permanent homes but temporary residences.
	    - Link this back to the temporary nature of the sukkah and the Feast of Tabernacles. It's a time to remember that our ultimate dwelling place will be with Yahweh in a renewed creation.
	- **Challenging Question**: "If our bodies are just 'tents,' what does this tell us about what is truly important in life?"
	- **Scriptural Proof**: 
	    - Read 2 Corinthians 5:1-5 where Paul discusses the earthly tent we live in and the building from God that we anticipate.
	    - You can also reference 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 where Paul talks about our bodies being temples of the Holy Spirit.
	- **Interactive Moment**: 
	    - Have a small tent or a picture of a tent and compare it to a solid building structure or a picture of one. Discuss why one is meant for a temporary stay while the other is designed for permanence.
#### Activity

1. **Building a Sukkah**
    - Each child creates a miniature sukkah using popsicle sticks, glue, and fabric. Have them decorate the tabernacles with things they want to symbolize the good fruit they want to have in their hearts.
