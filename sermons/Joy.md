## Knowing God is Eternal Life

The mother of all spiritual questions is: How can I have eternal life?

**John 17:3**
Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.

**1 John 2:3-6**
We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands. Whoever says, "I know him," but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person.

The Two Pillars of Eternal Life are to know God and keep His Commandments.

I've taught many times about the Two Pillars of Eternal Life, but sometimes we forget that loving God and keeping His Commandments is not just about what we don't do. It's also about what we do do.

Not only that, but we can become so well pleased once we think we have eternal life that we neglect to realize God's promise is not just for life in eternity but for today. We can lose momentum with our pursuit of God and, along with that loss, the loss of joy, hope, and purpose.

## Joy is the Fruit of Knowing God

**Galatians 5:22**
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy...

**Psalm 16:11**
You will show me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

**1 Peter 1:8-9**
Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

**Ephesians 5:18**
And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit

## Joy is a Superpower

> Joy is not the absence of pain but the ability to be content amid great suffering. 

**Psalm 94:19**
When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy.

**James 1:2**
My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.

**Philippians 4:11-13**
I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances… I can do all this through him who gives me strength.

**1 Thessalonians 5:16-18**
Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.

## Conclusion

**Illustration**: Tell the story about the scene from Bruce Almighty where Bruce calls out to God for a sign, but Bruce keeps missing God because he's not expecting an answer. God tries to call Bruce repeatedly, and after rejecting multiple calls from God, Bruce says, "Don't know ya and wouldn't call you back if I did."

**Proverbs 14:12** 
There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.

**Matthew 7:13-14**
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.

## Confession and Prayer

> “Father, I come before You, knowing I’ve looked for joy in places that don’t satisfy. I confess that I’ve turned to other things instead of to You. I want the joy that only comes from being close to You. I invite You to fill me with Your Spirit. Help me to seek You first and find my joy in You.”

> “My God and King, today I choose to turn away from these empty pursuits and fully turn my heart to You. I want the joy that only comes from Your presence. I want to know You deeply, to walk with You daily, and to find my delight in Your love and Your truth. I invite You to fill me with Your Spirit and to be my constant source of joy.”

> “Almighty God, I commit to seeking You first, in every moment and in every season. I open my heart to receive Your joy, a joy that endures, a joy that strengthens, and a joy that brings hope. Lord, help me love You with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength. You are my joy, now and always. In Yeshua's name, Amen.”
