**Exodus 20 **
"You do not steal"

**Why don't God's people steal or cheat?**

Stealing includes cheating and taking without permission

**What are examples of cheating or taking without permission?**

We temper the desire to cheat or steal by learning to be content

**1 Timothy 6:6**
Now godliness with contentment is great gain.

What is contentment? What are the benefits of contentment?

Contentment - a perfect condition of life in which no aid or support is needed

1 - Contentment is a choice

2 - Contentment is learned

**Philippians 4:11**

Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content
