title: Devotion Dealing with Difficulties and Distracti
---


Difficulty causes us to choose on of two responses, distraction or direction. Distraction seeks to create a louder voice than our pain or difficulty. The problem with that is A) we do not deal with the problem and B) we drown out the voice of God to give us the guidance we need. Being still is what we need. Committing to allowing time for God and others to speak direction into our life when needed. This must be sought proactively. If we are already in a place of distraction we will likely not seek A voice that might disturb our distraction.

We need God to shout at us to break the silence caused by our distraction.
