Exodus 20
4 You do not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of that which is in the heavens above, or which is in the earth beneath, or which is in the waters under the earth,

5 you do not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, Yahweh your Elohim am a jealous God, visiting the crookedness of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me

6 but showing loving-commitment to thousands, to those who love Me and guard My commands.

**Rulers and Judges**
The word “gods” or “mighty ones” mentioned in the First Commandment is a word used to describe something that rules or judges. In our modern world, consider how many things we let rule or judge us. Think about idols being things we serve ahead of other, more important things.

**Judgement and Consequence**
The second part of the second Commandment warns of idolatry's dire consequences. This sin, in particular, is what affected generations of Israelites because of the judgment God had to bring. Think about the people who had to wander in the Wilderness for 40 years because of the idolatry of others. Consider also the impact of parents who choose worldly convenience, comfort, or pursuits over God and how that impacts their children for generations.

**Blessing and Favor**
Standing in stark contrast to those who serve other gods is the eternal impact of those who serve God alone. There are over half a dozen references in the Bible where God says He showed kindness or favor to Israel because of His servant David.
