Do everything as unto the Lord

What does that mean to do everything as unto the Lord in work? Hobbies? In the Church?

There are three columns under which we might do something:

- Ourselves
- Others
- The Lord

Read Colossians 3

To do as unto the Lord means to do with His mind and expectations in focus.

What does the Lord expect? What is His mind? What does he find pleasing or displeasing?

Those are the questions we must answer before we can accurately assess whether we are doing something unto Him.

**Luke 16:15**

15 And He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

Doing unto the Lord requires us to:

- Not fret
- Pick up our cross
- Be obedient
- Focus on things eternal

The fruit:

- Peace
- Contentment
