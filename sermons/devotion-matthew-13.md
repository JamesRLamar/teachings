Matthew 5 teaches us that the good life is a life of simplicity. Riches cause spiritual blindness that deceives us from seeing our own depravity.

Revelation 3:16

[Matthew 13:22](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.13.22)

Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.

Worldly wealth will cause strain against the Word of God. It will attempt to strangle the truth until we are alive but bear no fruit. In our country, even selling all your possessions would do nothing to make you poor. Even our homeless have clean water, food and shelter. The answer is to be radically generous with our wealth and leave no room for worldly idols in our heart. The answer is not to be poor, but poor in spirit. From our inward person, we must be poor in spirit.
