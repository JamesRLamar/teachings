**Hebrews 5:12–14**
"For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."

### Meditation

Meditation sharpens the mind and disciplines the heart. Without meditation, the mind will wander, and the heart will grow wild.


**Psalm 1:2**
“But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and on His Law he meditates day and night.”  

**How the ancients meditated:**

- **Step One:** Select Psalm 1:2 and begin by reading it slowly out loud.
- **Step Two:** Whisper the verse softly to yourself, focusing on each phrase. Emphasize the word “delight,” contemplating what it means to find genuine joy in God’s Law.
- **Step Three:** Close your eyes and picture yourself sitting by a stream (imagery from Psalm 1). Reflect on what it means to be nourished by God’s commandments.
- **Step Four:** Spend a few moments after recitation simply dwelling on the phrase “day and night.” Ask: How can I incorporate the values of Scripture into both my daily routines and my quieter evenings?  
    **Outcome:** By gently uttering the verse, reflecting on its imagery, and internalizing its command, you turn the act of reading Scripture into a focused meditation that shapes your mindset.
    

1. **Psalm 1:2-3**  
    “But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.”  
    
2. **Joshua 1:8**  
    “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.” 
    
3. **Psalm 19:14**  
    “Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.” 
    
4. **Philippians 4:8**  
    “Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things.”  
    
5. **Psalm 119:15-16**  
    “I will meditate on Your precepts, and contemplate Your ways. I will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your word.”
