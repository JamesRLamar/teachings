You don't have to fight to win you have to surrender.

How to know whether you need to fight or surrender?

Answer this question based how you generally feel throughout the week.

In my finances, do I do enough?
In my relationship with God, do I do enough?
In leading my family, do I do enough?
If you answer "no", can you immediately identify what you need to be doing?

Many people who fight too much, think they aren't doing enough, but can't say what they need to do exactly. It's a feeling of not being enough.

Many people who should be fighting more, often think they are doing just fine. But it's really just trying to avoid the feeling of discomfort that would arise from the confrontation and realization that we are simply ignoring something important.

It differs in different areas of your life

Being aware is the first step, then being willing to confront the needed change.

Being aware can be painful, because it usually requires feeling hurtful emotions or acknowledging difficult facts.

Being willing is often combated by reluctance, distraction, and or excuses to delay.

**1 Corinthians 5**

20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christâ€™s behalf, be reconciled to God. 21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.

2 Chronicles 20, 15, 17, 22

Jacob, Gideon, Jonah, Balaam are examples of the reluctant and unaware

Here is an interesting observation. We often feel guilty or fearful of things we ought not to be concerned about. We often feel no conviction for things that really matter most. We do this because we have conditioned our conscience.
