What is the Spirit? The better question is who is the Spirit?

In Galatians 5 we read about the fruit of the Spirit, but has it ever stood out to you that the fruit of the Spirit actually come from us?

What do you think that means?

**Galatians 5:22-23**

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.

Let's divide this list and see something interesting. The first three fruit stand out as being different than the last six. The last six can all be emulated without the first three.

**Can you be patient with ill motive?**

**Can you be kind for selfish reasons?**

**Can you be good for an ulterior purpose?**

The first three fruit of the Spirit are the crux of them all. Love, Joy, and Peace are fixed perspectives through which we see ourselves and others. Love is a motive. Peace is a perspective. Joy is a state of mind.

We will read about love in 1 John, but let us remember the purpose of this letter:

**1 John 2:3a**
Now by this we know that we know Him...

**1 John 5:13a**
I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God...

**1 John 5:13b**
...so that you may know that you have eternal life.

# Love

**1 John 4:7**

Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.

**1 John 4:8**
Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.

**1 John 4:10**

This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.

**1 John 4:11**
Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

**1 John 4:16-17**

God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment...

**1 John 4:20**

Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.

**1 John 4:21**

And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.

# Peace

**John 14:27**

Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

# Joy

**Hebrews 12:2**

looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

**Hebrews 12:11**

Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.

So how are love, joy, and peace produced in our life?

They come by opening our heart to hear the voice of God to challenge and change us. We must be transformed in our thinking. As we have mentioned before, obedience to God's commands are essential, but that obedience is only possible through knowing Him intimately. As we all know, we become like the people we spend the most time with.

Think about who you spend the most time with and compare that to how much time you spend with God and others who love Him.
