**How do a lot of people pray?**
They pray for forgiveness and for things they want

**How did Jesus teach us to pray?**

**Matthew 6 ERV**

**5 **“When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites. They love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners and pray loudly. They want people to see them. The truth is, that’s all the reward they will get.

**6 **But when you pray, you should go into your room and close the door. Then pray to your Father. He is there in that private place. He can see what is done in private, and he will reward you.

**7 **“And when you pray, don’t be like the people who don’t know God. They say the same things again and again. They think that if they say it enough, their god will hear them. Don’t be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

**9** So this is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven, we pray that your name will always be kept holy.

We pray that your kingdom will come that what you want will be done here on earth, the same as in heaven.

Give us the food we need for today.
Forgive our sins, just as we have forgiven those who did wrong to us.
Don’t let us be tempted, but save us from the Evil One.

For the kingdom and the power and the glory belong to you forever and ever. Amen.

**14 **Yes, if you forgive others for the wrongs they do to you, then your Father in heaven will also forgive your wrongs.** **But if you don’t forgive others, then your Father in heaven will not forgive the wrongs you do.
