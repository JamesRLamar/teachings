title: The Disturbed vs The Comfortable

**The Disturbed vs The Comfortable**

**Exodus 2:23-24 NKJV**

During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

**Numbers 11 ERV**

1 The people started complaining about their troubles. The Lord heard their complaints. He heard these things and became angry. Fire from the Lord burned among the people. The fire burned some of the areas at the edge of the camp. 2 So the people cried to Moses for help. He prayed to the Lord and the fire stopped burning. 3 So that place was called Taberah (Burning). The people gave the place that name because the Lord caused a fire to burn in their camp.

4 The foreigners who had joined the Israelites began wanting other things to eat. Soon all the Israelites began complaining again. The people said, “We want to eat meat! 5 We remember the fish we ate in Egypt. That fish cost us nothing. We also had good vegetables like cucumbers, melons, chives, onions, and garlic. 6 But now we have lost our strength. We never eat anything—only this manna!”

10 Moses heard the people complaining. People from every family were sitting by their tents and complaining. The Lord became very angry, and this made Moses very upset. 11 He asked the Lord, “Why did you bring this trouble on me? I am your servant. What did I do wrong? What did I do to upset you? Why did you give me responsibility over all these people?

12 You know that I am not the father of all these people. You know that I did not give birth to them. But I must take care of them, like a nurse carrying a baby in her arms. Why do you force me to do this? Why do you force me to carry them to the land that you promised to our fathers? 13 I don’t have enough meat for all these people! And they continue complaining to me. They say, ‘Give us meat to eat!’

14 I cannot take care of all these people alone. The burden is too heavy for me. 15 If you plan to continue giving me their troubles, kill me now. If you accept me as your servant, let me die now. Then I will be finished with all my troubles!”

16 The Lord said to Moses, “Bring to me 70 of the elders of Israel. These men are the leaders among the people. Bring them to the Meeting Tent. Let them stand there with you. 17 Then I will come down and speak with you there. The Spirit is on you now. But I will also give some of that Spirit to them. Then they will help you take care of the people. In this way you will not have to be responsible for these people alone.

18 “Tell the people this: Make yourselves ready for tomorrow. Tomorrow you will eat meat. The Lord heard you when you cried out and said, ‘We need meat to eat! It was better for us in Egypt!’ So now the Lord will give you meat. And you will eat it. 19 You will eat it for more than one, or two, or five, or ten, or even twenty days! 20 You will eat that meat for a whole month until you are sick of it. This will happen to you because you complained against the Lord. He lives among you and knows what you need, but you cried and complained to him! You said, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’”

21 Moses said, “There are 600,000 soldiers here, and you say, ‘I will give them enough meat to eat for a whole month!’ 22 If we were to kill all the sheep and cattle, that would still not be enough to feed this many people for a month. And if we caught all the fish in the sea, it would not be enough for them!”

23 But the Lord said to Moses, “Don’t limit my power! You will see that I can do what I say I can do.”

**How do we walk away from Egypt and keep focused on God?**

**What things in our lives often represent Egypt or the Comfort of the Prison?**

**What things might represent the Promise?**

**Why would we be enticed to go back to Prison?**

**What things might distract us from God’s Promise?**

**Takeaway:**

The Israelites spent 40 years on a journey to the Promised Land, a journey that should have only lasted about 11 days.

It wasn’t distance that stood between them and the Promised Land. It was the condition of their hearts. They were ungrateful, immature, and discontent. They had lost perspective and forgot all the miracles God had done for them.

You see, God’s purpose went deeper than simply transporting a huge group of people to a new land.  He was preparing them to live in obedience to Him once they arrived. He was more concerned with their spiritual condition than He was their physical condition.

Their journey was a painful but necessary part of their preparation. Your spiritual journey will be lengthy. You will face pain, discouragement and heartache along the way - but remember, God isn’t just trying to keep you alive. He’s not interested in your survival, He’s interested in your revival.

He wants to prepare you for His purposes. He is pruning you so that you reflect Him in all things. The journey may be hard; you may be frustrated, uncomfortable and want to give up, but don’t.  Keep going, run your race, and allow God to prune away all that is not of Him.

Our prayer should be for God to comfort the disturbed, but to disturb the comfortable.

**What is the source of discouragement?**

It can come from broken perspective or lost hope. It can also come from God allowing you to see a legitimate need so that you call on Him to help you.

**What does it mean to have hope?**
Hope means to wait, to expect, and to trust.

Lastly, do not forget that we are at war. Consider the parting words of Paul to the Church in Ephesus.

**Ephesians 6:10-12 NKJV**

Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.

**Romans 5:1-5 NKJV**

1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.

Endurance is quickly gained and quickly lost. Character represents the person who has been tried many times and the dross has all burned away. They are pure and resolute. Hope the final quality of someone who has allowed themselves to be perfected by Gods loving discipline.
