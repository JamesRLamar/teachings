‭‭Acts‬ ‭2‬:‭42‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.”

*What’s the meaning of “Steadfast” Picture a steadfast person standing firmly in place, not wavering or budging an inch.*

*
*

*The word apostle at its root means “one who is sent.” Doctrine is simply teaching. So apostolic doctrine is teaching that comes to us through the apostles, those specifically chosen by Christ to carry His teachings to the world.*

‭‭Acts‬ ‭2‬:‭46‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,”

Ephesians 4:5-15

“And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,”

‭‭
*What is going on in your head as you read this? *

*I think naturally we want to ask where do I fit in to these gifting’s.  What is the work of the ministry in this day and age? *

“for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;

*Do we feel fully equipped for the ministry? Are we contributing to building the body on a daily basis? *

that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,

‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭4‬:‭12‬-‭16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ— from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.”

Romans‬ ‭12‬:‭6‬-‭8‬, ‭11‬ ‭

“We all have different gifts. Each gift came because of the grace God gave us. Whoever has the gift of prophecy should use that gift in a way that fits the kind of faith they have.

Whoever has the gift of serving should serve. Whoever has the gift of teaching should teach. Whoever has the gift of comforting others should do that.

Whoever has the gift of giving to help others should give generously. Whoever has the gift of leading should work hard at it.

Whoever has the gift of showing kindness to others should do it gladly. As you serve the Lord, work hard and don’t be lazy. Be excited about serving him!”
