title: Trusting in God with a Perfect Heart
---


**2 Chronicles 16:9** (paraphrased)

The eyes of God are looking over the whole earth for someone whose heart is perfect towards Him, so that He can make them super strong. But if you trust in yourself you will have many battles from now on.

**Illustration:**

Imagine this glass represents our hearts. God wants to fill every part of our thoughts, intentions, passions, dreams, desires, and everything else in-between. (Pour water into the cup and drink from it)

This is what God wants. A pure heart that is fully committed to Him and perfect. Free from anything else good or bad. Now imagine that I decide to let just a little bit of sin into my life.  (Grab a tiny piece of poop and put in the glass of water and drink some)

**What’s wrong with this?**

**Why is sin like that tiny piece of poop?**

**Does it matter if there is a little piece of poop or a big piece?**

**If this glass is our heart, what does God want it to be like?**

**How much would you have to wash this glass before you felt good drinking from it again?**

**1 John 1:5-9**

5 This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.

7 But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.

8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

**Read 2 Chronicles 16:9 again.**

**2 Chronicles 16:9** (paraphrased)

The eyes of God are looking over the whole earth for someone whose heart is perfect towards Him, so that He can make them super strong. But if you trust in yourself you will have many battles from now on.

**Do you know why God wants a heart that is perfect now?**

**According to the last part of that verse, what happens if we don’t have a perfect heart towards Him?**

**God wants a heart completely His. **
