title: Family Devotion Walking in the Spirit Part 2

**Illustration:**

Have two bowls with two different fruit in each one. Ask the children what kind of fruit they are what kinds of trees each grow from.

Can apples come from banana trees? Can bananas come from apple trees?

What kind of fruit comes from the spirit? What kind of fruit comes from sin?

The Bible tells us we who believe in Christ have two natures even after we commit our lives to God. There is the spiritual nature and the sinful nature. Everyone has a sinful nature because that is how we are born. But the spiritual nature is different. Let's talk about the fruit that comes from us and decide what kind of fruit tree we want to be.

**Read Galatians 5:22-25 GW**

But the spiritual nature produces love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, and self-control. There are no laws against things like that. 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their corrupt nature along with its passions and desires. 25 If we live by our spiritual nature, then our lives need to conform to our spiritual nature.

How do we live by our spiritual nature? How to we bear spiritual fruit instead of fruit like the world?

Verse 24 says that living by our sinful nature or else choosing to live by our spiritual nature has to do with two things:

Our passions and desires

Are passion and desire bad? No, they are not bad, but what we desire and are passionate about can be bad fruit indeed.

**Show the two bowls of fruit. **

The plant that gets water and good food for the soil and sunshine, that’s the plant that will be good fruit.

Put the fruit together in the same bowl. Ask the question: Now what would happen if I put the two tress right on top of each other, but I tried really hard to only water the orange tree? Both trees will die because they will destroy each others while fighting for the water and nutrients. So are we like. We cannot feed both our sinful and spiritual nature and expect to live or bear good fruit. We will die.

Here is how we practically know whether the choice we are making is spiritual or sinful:

We ask ourselves if this is feeding our sinful desire/passion or spiritual desire. If our action looks like the fruit of the world then it is sin. If our action looks like something Jesus would do its spiritual.

**Reflection:**

Read the verses before and after the family reading. Discuss how it is impossible to inherit the Kingdom of God if we continue feed both our sinful and spiritual nature no matter how good our intentions are. Feeding both will still produce death the same as if we only fed our sinful nature.
