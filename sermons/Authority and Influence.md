The more authority you have the softer you can to speak to influence others. The less authority you have the louder you have to speak to get others to move. Sometimes speaking loudly is a reflection of your lack of consistency or character. Sometimes it is a reflection of the hearer's lack of character.

For example, when Madison tries to tell our dog to sit he doesn't listen to her even if she raises her voice. However, I've spent time teaching him to respect me so usually listens, but he's still forgetful and stubborn, thus he needs to be reminded often.

So were the people of Israel when they heard God's voice from Mount Sinai. God's voice was heard through earthquakes, fire, and thunder because the people were forgetful and stubborn.

But consider Elijah who needed only the still small voice of God to receive instruction. Or consider the story of young Samuel who could hear the inaudible whisper of God's Spirit within.

Do you have the respect of your children or those you lead? Do you find yourself having to yell or threaten to influence others? If so, do you think that is a reflection of your character or theirs?

How loud does God have to speak to get your attention?
