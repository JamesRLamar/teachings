title: The Fruit of Self Control
---



1. Self-control is the mechanism that unlocks the other fruit
2. The discipline of "self" is critical to loving oneself
3. Without vision, we will lack self-control
4. The proof is in the pudding

# 1. Self-control is the mechanism that unlocks the other fruit

- Spiritual fruit is a supernatural byproduct of being spiritually healthy.
- Being spiritually healthy requires regular pruning. 
- By cultivating the inner life, we bring glory to God and life to our souls. 
- The "self" should be seen as a child that cannot be trusted to make good decisions. It is the nature we might return to if we lose vision.
- We must renew our minds to stay refreshed by His Spirit. 

**Galatians 5:22-23**
But the fruit of the Spirit is self-control...

**Hebrews 12:11**
No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.

**Romans‬ ‭12‬:‭2**
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you prove what is that good and well-pleasing and perfect desire of Elohim.

**Proverbs 4:13**
Cling to discipline. Do not relax your grip on it. Keep it because it is your life.

# 2. The discipline of "self" is critical to loving oneself

- Discipling of "self" is a demonstration of love for oneself and love for God. 
- What does that say if you don't discipline the "self"?

**Hebrews 12:6** 
For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.

**Proverbs 12:1**
Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid.

# 3. Without vision, we will lack self-control

- Vision is being able to visualize the fruitful self
- Vision is also being to see your present excuses for what they are
- When we lack vision, we are more put off by the discomfort needed for change than we are in the suffering of our present brokenness

**Proverbs 29:18**
Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;
But happy is he who keeps the law.

**‭Proverbs 25‬:‭28‬ ‭**
A man who has no control over his spirit Is like a broken-down city without a wall.

# 4. The proof is in the pudding

- If you say you believe, but you do not consistently connect with Him, no one believes you

**1 John 2:5-6**
But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this, we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.

**James 2:19-20**
You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?
