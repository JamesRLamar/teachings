**Daniel 4 PARAPHRASE**

1-2 King Nebuchadnezzar to everyone, everywhere "Peace and prosperity to all! It is my privilege to report to you the gracious miracles that the Most High God has done for me.

3 "His miracles are amazing,
    his wonders will blow your mind.
His kingdom lasts and lasts,
    his reign goes on forever.

4-7 "I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home taking it easy in my palace, without a care in the world. But as I laid down to sleep I had a dream that scared me—a nightmare that shook me. I sent for all the wise men of Babylon so that they could interpret the dream for me. When they were all assembled—magicians, fortunetellers, and witches—I told them the dream. None could tell me what it meant.

8 "And then Daniel came in...A man full of the divine Holy Spirit. I told him my dream.

9 "‘Daniel,’ I said, ‘chief of the magicians, I know that you are a man full of the divine Holy Spirit and that there is no mystery that you can’t solve. Listen to this dream that I had and interpret it for me.

19 After the dream was told to Daniel he was very upset. The thoughts that came swarming into his mind terrified him. The king said, "stay calm. Don’t let the dream and its interpretation scare you.” Daniel said, "I wish this dream were about your enemies."

22 Daniel said, "You have grown great and strong King Neb. Your royal majesty reaches sky-high, and your rule stretches over the whole world."

23-25 "But the part of the dream about the holy angel descending from heaven and proclaiming, "Chop down the tree, destroy it"—this, O king, refers to you. It means that the High God has sentenced my master the king: You will be driven away from the world and live with the wild animals. You will graze on grass like an ox. You will be rained on and live in the wild. This will go on for seven years, and you will learn that the Most High God rules over all kingdoms and that He controls all things."

27 "So, king, take my advice: Repent of your sins and give your wealth to the poor. Quit your wicked life and live to serve others. Then you may continue to have a good life."

28-30 All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. Just twelve months later, he was walking on the balcony of the royal palace started to praise himself, "Look at this beautiful place, Babylon the great! And I built it all by myself, a royal palace to display my honor and my glory!”

31-32 Right after he spoke the last of those words, a voice spoke from Heaven, "King Nebuchadnezzar: Your kingdom is now taken from you. You will be driven out to live with the wild animals. You will eat grass like an ox. You will remain this way for seven years until enough time has passed that you learn that the Most High God rules over all things and controls all things, not you!"

33 In that very second, Nebuchadnezzar was driven out into the wild and started eating grass like an ox. His hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a hawk.

34-35 At the end of the seven years, Nebuchadnezzar came to his senses. Then he declared, "I was given my mind back and I blessed the Most High God, thanking and glorifying God, who lives forever:

“God's reign lasts and lasts,
    his kingdom never declines and falls.
Life on this earth doesn’t affect Him,
    but God controls all things and keeps the world in balance.
No one can interrupt His work,
    no one can question Him.

37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, give praise, honor, and glory to the King of Heaven. Everything he does is right. He is always fair, and he is able to make proud people humble!
