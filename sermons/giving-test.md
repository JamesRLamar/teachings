# The Giving Test

> "No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon." (Matthew 6:24)

Generosity isn't a spiritual bonus — it's the litmus test of genuine faith. Where your treasure is, your heart is also. And if your heart clings to mammon, you cannot claim to serve God.

## Opening Illustration

[NEED: Personal story or illustration about a time when you wrestled with giving something valuable — money, time, comfort. Make it real and vulnerable. Show the internal conflict between security and surrender.]

**Question:** What would Jesus have to ask you to give up before you'd walk away sad?

### 1. God is generous

Deuteronomy 15:7-8 (NKJV):

“You shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother.”

Question:

What does my heart toward giving or not giving say about what I believe about God?

### 2. God Commands Us to Remember the Poor

> "They desired only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do." (Galatians 2:10)


**Teaching Point:**

Generosity toward the poor wasn't Paul's optional side-ministry — it was the singular charge the apostles gave him when sending him out with the Gospel.


**Question:**

If caring for the poor is inseparable from the Gospel message, what does our giving (or lack of it) reveal about whether we truly believe the Gospel?

### 3. Faith Without Generosity Is Dead

> "But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?" (1 John 3:17)

**Teaching Point:**
John doesn't ask whether God's love is *strong* in someone who ignores the needy — he questions whether it's in them *at all*.

**Question:**
James says faith without works is dead, and the example he gives is meeting the physical needs of the poor (James 2:15-17). If your faith were measured by your generosity alone, would it be alive or dead?

### 4. You Can Keep the Commandments and Still Lose Your Soul

**In the past year, how many days did you go without:**
- Any shelter?
- Any warmth in winter?
- Any clothes?
- Any food?
- Any clean water?

**In the past year, how many days did you:**
- Pay someone else to provide a shelter?
- Pay someone else to heat your home?
- Pay someone else to make your clothes?
- Pay someone else to cook your meals?
- Pay someone else to bring you water?

Can you relate to the rich young ruler? Are you rich in this present age?

> "Now as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, 'Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?'... Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, 'One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.' But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions." (Mark 10:17, 21-22)

**Teaching Point:**
The rich young ruler kept all the commandments, but when Jesus exposed what he truly worshiped, he walked away sad — because his possessions possessed him.

## Closing

> "Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share, storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life." (1 Timothy 6:17-19)

The rich young ruler was sad because he finally saw what he'd been worshiping all along. His wealth was his god, and when Jesus asked him to surrender it, he couldn't.

Where your treasure is, your heart is also.

Jesus isn't asking you to give because He's cruel — He's asking you to give because He loves you and knows that mammon is a terrible master. It promises security but delivers anxiety. It promises satisfaction but delivers endless craving.


**Reflection:**

- Where does your treasure say your heart is?

- What would Jesus have to ask you to give up before you'd walk away sad?

- If your bank account was laid bare before your church family, would they say you love God or love mammon?

- When you imagine giving sacrificially, what emotion rises first — joy or anxiety?
