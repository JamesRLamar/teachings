**Hurry Sickness** - hurry is a self-inflicted disease, a form of violence on our own soul

# 10 Signs and Symptoms of Hurry Sickness

1 - **Irritability**—You get mad, frustrated, or just annoyed way too easily. Little, normal things irk you. People have to tiptoe around your ongoing low-grade negativity, if not anger.

2 - **Hypersensitivity**—All it takes is a minor comment to hurt your feelings, the ordinary problems of life have a disproportionate effect on your emotional well-being.

3 - **Restlessness**—When you actually do try to slow down and rest, you can’t relax. You give Sabbath a try, and you hate it. You read Scripture but find it boring. You have quiet time with God but can’t focus your mind.

4 - **Workaholism** (or just nonstop activity)—You just don’t know when to stop. Or worse, you can’t stop. Result: you fall prey to “sunset fatigue,” where by day’s end you have nothing left to give to your spouse, children, or loved ones. They get the grouchy, curt, overtired you, and it’s not pretty.

5 - **Emotional numbness**—You just don’t have the capacity to feel. You live in this kind of constant numb fatigue.

6 - **Out-of-order priorities**—You feel disconnected from your identity and calling. You’re always getting sucked into the tyranny of the urgent, not the important. You’re busier than ever before yet still feel like you don’t have time for what really matters to you.

7 - **Lack of care for your body**—You don’t have time for the basics: eight hours of sleep a night; daily exercise; healthy, home-cooked food; minimal stimulants; margin. You gain weight. Get sick multiple times a year. Regularly wake up tired. Don’t sleep well. Live off the four horsemen of the industrialized food apocalypse: caffeine, sugar, processed carbs, and alcohol.

8 - **Escapist behaviors**—When we’re too tired to do what’s actually life giving for our souls, we each turn to our distraction of choice: overeating, over-drinking, binge-watching Netflix, browsing social media, surfing the web. Escapes can be good; but when we abuse them to escape from reality, they eat us alive. You find yourself stuck in the negative feedback loop of socially acceptable addictions.

9 - **Slippage of spiritual disciplines**—If you’re anything like me, when you get overbusy, the things that are truly life giving for your soul are the first to go rather than your first go to—such as a quiet time in the morning, Scripture, prayer, or a meaningful Sabbath.

10 - **Isolation**—You feel disconnected from God, others, and your own soul. On those rare times when you actually stop to pray (and by pray I don’t mean ask God for stuff; I mean sit with God in the quiet), you’re so stressed and distracted that your mind can’t settle down long enough to enjoy the Father’s company.

"Wilderness" (erēmos) - a solitary, uninhabited, uncultivated, and quiet place

**Matthew 3:1-3**

In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the ***wilderness*** of Judea, and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!” For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying:

The voice of one crying in the ***wilderness***:
Prepare the way of the Lord;
Make His paths straight

**Matthew 4:1**

Then Jesus was ***led*** up by the Spirit into the ***wilderness*** to be tempted by the devil.

"Led" (anagō) - of navigators: launch out, set sail, put to sea

**Mark 1:12**
Immediately the Spirit ***drove*** Him into the ***wilderness***.

"Drove" (ekballō) - to cast out, drive out, send forth with the notion of violence, to expel or compel

**Matthew 14**

13 When Jesus heard it, He departed from there by boat to a ***deserted place*** by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities. And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick.

15 When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, “This is a ***deserted place***, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.”

16 But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”

22 Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away.

23 And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the ***mountain by Himself*** to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there.

**Mark 1:35**

Now in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a ***solitary place***; and there He prayed.

**Luke 5:16**
So He Himself often withdrew into the ***wilderness*** and prayed.

**Hebrews 4**
9 Consequently, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

10 For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.

11 Therefore let’s make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience.

**1 Thessalonians 4:11**
Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life...

**What if hearing God's voice is less about coaxing Him to speak and more about calming our minds to hear?**

The Yoke of Jesus is an invitation; to live as He lived. To follow Him as The Way, like actually.

**Where is the Holy Spirit driving you?**

**Have you allowed yourself to be driven by a different spirit?**

"For many of us the great danger is not that we will renounce our faith. It is that we will become so distracted and rushed and preoccupied that we will settle for a mediocre version of it. We will just skim our lives instead of actually living them." - John Ortberg

**Getting back to the survey we took at the beginning, how much of your life would change if you became ruthlessly devoted to the critical need for quiet with the Creator?**
