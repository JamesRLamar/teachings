**Where is the line between a lie and a white lie?**

**Is a white lie still a lie?**

**Honesty is respected all over the world, but when it comes to our own behavior many of us have a different level of expectations. We lower the standard of what is right and wrong to serve our own needs. We imagine creative ways of justifying our behavior like we do with white lies. White lies might be little things, but we will learn from the reading today and Jesus cares about honesty, especially in the little things.**

**Luke 16:1-13 ERV**

Jesus said to his followers, “Once there was a rich man. He hired a manager to take care of his business. Later, he learned that his manager was cheating him. So he called the manager in and said to him, ‘I have heard bad things about you. Give me a report of what you have done with my money. You can’t be my manager anymore.’

“So, the manager thought to himself, ‘What will I do? My master is taking my job away from me. I am not strong enough to dig ditches. I am too proud to beg. I know what I will do! I will do something to make friends, so that when I lose my job, they will welcome me into their homes.’

“So the manager called in each person who owed the master some money. He asked the first one, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ He answered, ‘I owe him 100 jars of olive oil.’ The manager said to him, ‘Here is your bill. Hurry! Sit down and make the bill less. Write 50 jars.’ “Then the manager asked another one, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ He answered, ‘I owe him 100 measures of wheat.’ Then the manager said to him, ‘Here is your bill; you can make it less. Write 80 measures.’ Later, the master told the dishonest manager that he had done a clever thing.

Jesus said, “Worldly people are more crafty in their business with each other than God's people are."

“I tell you, use the worldly things you have now to make ‘friends’ for eternity. Then, when those things are gone, you will be welcomed into a home that lasts forever.

Whoever can be trusted with small things can also be trusted with big things. Whoever is dishonest in little things will be dishonest in big things too.

If you cannot be trusted with worldly riches, you will not be trusted with the true riches. And if you cannot be trusted with the things that belong to someone else, you will not be given anything of your own.

“You cannot serve two masters at the same time. You will hate one master and love the other. Or you will be loyal to one and not care about the other. You cannot serve God and Money at the same time.”

**What kind lessons can we learn from this story?**
**
**
**Does Jesus care about honesty?**
**
**
**Does Jesus care about the little things?**
**
**
**Does Jesus care about how we spend money?**
**
**

**Did you notice that Jesus tells the story as if to say that all money belongs to God and we are just managers of it?**

**
**
**What does it say if we work hard to spend all that money on ourselves?**
**
**
**What should we spend money on?**
**
**
**Luke 16:14-15 NKJV**

Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they derided Him. And He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
