**What does it take to cultivate the fruit of God’s Spirit?**

Our worldly and intuitive response might be: "Try harder". "Try harder" is far from the truth. Bearing the fruit of His Spirit comes from spiritual thinking and an eternal perspective that’s in step with His Mind (His Spirit).

It is not: try harder
It is: to love well, listen well
It is: to rejoice, renew your mind
It is: to find peace, seek the Peacemaker

It is in allowing our minds to be reshaped and renewed daily that we are cutting away the dead things and making room for new life to spring forth. Cultivating the Fruit of the Spirit springs forth when we cultivate our mind, our perspective. The opposite it true as well. Think of the old adage, "you are what you eat". If we choose and dwell on unspiritual or untruthful things we shall reap from those thoughts as well.

**[Patience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience) (Longsuffering)**

Patience (or forbearance) is the ability to endure difficult circumstances. Patience may involve perseverance in the face of delay; tolerance of provocation without responding in disrespect/anger; or forbearance when under strain, especially when faced with longer-term difficulties, or being able to wait for a long amount of time without getting irritated or bored. Patience is the level of endurance one can have before disrespect. It is also used to refer to the character trait of being steadfast.

**Romans 2:4**

Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?

**1 Timothy 1:16**

However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life.

**What perspective creates the Fruit of Patience?**
