title: Devotion When Prayers becomes Promises
---


**How do people pray?**
**
**
**1 Peter 5:8-10 **TS2009

**8 **Be sober, watch, because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.

**9 **Resist him, firm in the belief, knowing that the same hardships are experienced by your brotherhood in the world.

**10**  *And* the Elohim of all favor, who called you to His everlasting esteem by Messiah Yeshua, after you have suffered a while, Himself, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.

**1 Peter 5:10 **NKJV

*But may***  **the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.

**How should we pray?**

**Prayers become Promises when we:**
1. **Align** with His will
2. **Believe** He will do it
3. **Claim** His Promises as Truth

**Matthew 6:9-13**
**9 **In this manner, therefore, pray:
Our Father in heaven,
Hallowed be Your name.

**10** Your kingdom come.
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven.

**11** Give us this day our daily bread.

**12 **And forgive us our debts,
As we forgive our debtors.

**13** And do not lead us into temptation,
But deliver us from the evil one.
For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.

**James 1:5-7**

**5** If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.

**6 **But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;

**James 4:2-3**

**2 **You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask.

**
**

**3** You ask and do not receive, because you ask **amiss**, that you may spend it on your pleasures.

"Amiss" - badly diseased or improper

**Matthew 7:11**

If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!

Illustration of someone trying to attach my daughter.

Don’t pray like you’re trying to convince God of something you need.

**Luke 10:38-41**

**38 **Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word.

**40 **But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.”

**41 **And Jesus answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things.** **But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.”

**Matthew 9:20-22**

And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment. For she said to herself, “If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.” But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, “Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour.

**Luke 8:42-48**
**42** But as He went, the multitudes thronged Him.

**43** Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any, came from behind and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.

**45a** And Jesus said, **“Who touched Me?”**

**45b** When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’ ”

**46** But Jesus said, “Somebody touched Me, for I perceived power going out from Me.”

**47** Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.

**48** And He said to her, “Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
