title: Fear of God Family Lesson
---


## 1. Introduction

**Hook**:  
Begin by inviting the children to share an experience that made them feel a sense of awe—perhaps seeing a beautiful sunset, the power of a storm, or something grand in nature. As they share, use this to transition into how encountering God in His holiness evokes a similar feeling. Say, “When people in the Bible met God, they didn’t just feel amazement; they felt something called the 'fear of God.' But this isn’t the kind of fear you feel when you're scared of something bad. It's more like being amazed and full of respect.”

**Scripture Tie-in**:  
**Proverbs 9:10**  
*“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.”*  
Explain that the "fear" here is not about being scared but about revering God, trusting in His power, and respecting Him deeply—like how we respect a parent or teacher because of their authority and wisdom.

## 2. Main Points

### 1. Fear of God as Awe and Respect

**Scripture**: **Exodus 19:16-19**  
*“On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled. Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently. As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.”*

- **Illustration**:  
  Paint a vivid picture of the event at Mount Sinai—thunder, lightning, and a thick cloud covering the mountain as God’s presence descended. The Israelites trembled, not out of fear like running from danger, but because they were in awe of God’s overwhelming holiness and power.  
  *"Imagine standing there and feeling the ground shake as God spoke. How would that make you feel?"*

- **Additional Insight**:  
  **Psalm 33:8**  
  *“Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.”*  
  This reinforces the idea that God’s power and holiness should inspire awe in all creation.

- **Application**:  
  Ask the children, “How do you show respect for important people in your life—like your parents or teachers?” Guide them to understand that we show respect for God through worship, obedience, and reverence. Encourage them to think of ways they can show respect for God in their daily lives, such as praying, listening to His Word, and being kind to others.

### 2. Fear of God as Trusting His Power and Authority

**Scripture**: **Matthew 10:28**  
*“Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.”*

- **Illustration**:  
  Use the analogy of a teacher in a classroom who has authority but who cares for the students. God's power is much greater—He is in control of everything, even life and death—but we don’t need to be afraid because He loves us and is always looking out for us.

- **Further Exploration**:  
  **Psalm 115:11**  
  *“You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord—He is their help and shield.”*  
  This shows how fearing God means trusting Him in times of uncertainty or fear.

- **Application**:  
  Invite the children to think about things that make them feel scared or anxious. Help them to see that trusting in God’s power can give them peace, even in difficult situations. Ask, “How can we trust God more when we feel afraid?” Encourage them to pray, ask for His help, and remember that He is in control.

### 3. Fear of God as Love and Obedience

**Scripture**: **Deuteronomy 10:12**  
*“And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to Him, to love Him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.”*

- **Illustration**:  
  Use the example of a child who obeys their parents, not because they’re afraid of getting in trouble, but because they love and want to please them.  
  *"Have you ever done something for someone you love just because you knew it would make them happy?"*  
  Explain that fearing God means loving Him so much that we want to obey Him, not out of fear of punishment, but out of a deep desire to honor and love Him.

- **Application**:  
  Encourage the children to think of one thing they can do this week to show their love for God through obedience. Suggest simple acts like being kind, sharing, praying, or reading their Bible. Encourage them to write it down and ask God to help them follow through.

## 3. Conclusion (Summary and Call to Action)

**Summary**:  
Remind the children that fearing God is not about being scared of Him. It’s about respecting His power, trusting Him, and loving Him so much that we want to obey. His holiness should inspire us to live in a way that honors Him.

**Call to Action**:  
Challenge them to think about one way they can show their respect and love for God this week. It could be through prayer, showing more respect for their parents, helping someone in need, or obeying God in another area of their life. Encourage them to share their ideas and support one another in following through.

## 4. Possible Activities

1. **Awe and Wonder Craft**:  
   - **Activity**: Have the children create a drawing or painting of something that makes them feel awe—like the mountains, the ocean, or the stars. When they finish, discuss how these things remind us of God’s great power and how we can show awe and respect for Him in our lives.
   - **Scripture Connection**:  
     **Psalm 19:1**  
     *“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.”*

2. **Obedience Pledge**:  
   - **Activity**: Give each child a small heart-shaped piece of paper where they can write one thing they will do this week to show love and obedience to God. Tell them to hang their heart somewhere in their room so they can see it every day as a reminder to follow through.
   - **Scripture Connection**:  
     **John 14:15**  
     *“If you love me, keep my commands.”*
