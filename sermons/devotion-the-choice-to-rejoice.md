**Psalms‬ ‭5:1-12‬ ‭TS2009‬‬**
Give ear to my words, O Yahweh,

Consider my meditation. Attend to the voice of my cry, My Sovereign and my Elohim, For unto You I pray.

O Yahweh, in the morning You hear my voice; I present myself to You in the morning, And I look up.

For You are not an God taking delight in wrong, Nor does evil dwell with You. The boasters do not stand before Your eyes;

You hate all workers of wickedness. You destroy those speaking falsehood; Yahweh loathes a man of blood and deceit.

But I, I enter Your house In the greatness of Your loving-commitment; I bow myself toward Your holy Temple in Your fear.

O Yahweh, lead me in Your righteousness because of those watching me; Make Your way straight before my face.

For there is no stability in their mouth; Their inward part is destruction; Their throat is an open burial-site; They flatter with their tongue.

Declare them guilty, O Elohim! Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them away for their many transgressions, Because they have rebelled against You.

But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; Let them ever shout for joy, because You shelter them;

And let those who love Your Name rejoice in You.

For You bless the righteous, O Yahweh; You surround him with favour as with a shield.

**James‬ ‭1:2-4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬**

‭‭“My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.”

‭‭

**Hebrews‬ ‭12:1-4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬**

Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,

looking unto Yeshua, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls. You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin.
