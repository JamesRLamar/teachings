**Illustration**: Have everyone take turns hanging from the pull-up bar or holding onto a heavy object. Make sure this is safe.

**Proverbs 4:13**
Cling to discipline. Do not relax your grip on it. Keep it because it is your life.

**What is discipline?**
Discipline is correction or instruction.

**Where does discipline come from?**
It can come from God, others, or ourselves.

**What does it look like when God disciplines us?**

**What does it look like when we discipline ourselves?**

**What does being disciplined by others look like?**

**What is your life?**

**Proverbs 4:23**
Guard your heart more than anything else, because the **source of your life** flows from it.

**What is your heart?**
Your thoughts, feelings, motives. Your inner life.

**How can discipline help us guard our life?**

**Self-control is a fruit of Spirit. How can we reap the fruit of self-control?**

**Galatians 5:16-18**
I say then: **Walk in the Spirit**, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. But **if you are led by the Spirit**, you are not under the law.
