title: Family Devotion Be Innocent
---


**
**

"Innocent" means to be pure or not mixed. It means to be "one" thing, not more than one.

**Matthew‬ ‭10:16‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬**

I am sending you to a people who are like wolves and you are like sheep. Therefore, it is important that you learn to be wise and cautious like snakes, but also gentle and **innocent** like doves.

**Romans 16:19**

Many people know you stand up for Jesus, therefore, I am happy because of that. However, I want you to be wise about what's actually good and completely **innocent** concerning things that are evil.

**Philippians 2:15**

For then you will be seen as **innocent** and **pure** children of God, even though you live in a wicked and perverted world. For compared to them you will look like shining lights in the universe.

**1 Corinthians 15:33**
So stop fooling yourselves! Worldly friends will poison your good character.

"Good" in this verse means to be good or pleasant tasting. This verse is referring to the fruit of the Spirit which should be good and pleasant to others.

**Illustration:**

Get two clear glasses of water, but fill one from a water filter and one from the toilet (not really, just put a little white vinegar). Ask the children to look from a couple feet away and say if they can "see" a difference. Then ask them to come closer and say if they can "smell" a difference. Ask if anyone wants to see if they can tastes a difference. Talk about what makes water pure or impure and then begin the lesson.
