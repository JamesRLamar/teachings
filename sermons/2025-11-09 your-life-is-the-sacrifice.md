## My Sacrifice

The brazen altar looms ahead, flames reach high up toward heaven, heat waves sweep across my face from twenty feet away. The smell of smoke rises, carrying the prayers of a thousand saints. Beyond the veil dwells the presence of a holy God I cannot see, cannot touch, dare not approach without reverence, awe of the highest degree.

I approach with a lamb, warm, held in my arms. I feel my heart racing as I press it to my chest. It cost me a month's wages. I've inspected it a hundred times—no blemish, no spot. Perfect.

The priest takes the lamb. I recall this isn't just an animal, it's my sin, my sacrifice. 

But here's the mystery of the New Covenant, we don't bring a lamb anymore. Jesus paid that price. But now you are the sacrifice. Alive. Breathing. Offered daily on the altar of your ordinary life.

Is your life a pleasing sacrifice to God?

## 1. Your Life Is the Sacrifice

> "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service." (Romans 12:1)

>"Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name. But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased." (Hebrews 13:15-16)

What sacrifices was he referring to?

What are the different ways we can worship?
- poetry - singing songs or writing songs
- silent meditation
- serving
- fasting

## 2. Worship in Spirit

>"But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." (John 4:23-24)

> "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal." (1 Corinthians 13:1)

What language does God speak?

We need to worship God in the language that He speaks. Everything else is anti-worship.

## 3. Worship in Truth

> "These people draw near to Me with their mouth, and honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me." (Matthew 15:8)

The greatest tragedy is to worship without worshiping. 

What does it mean to worship in truth?

## 4. Everything is Worship

>"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
>
>"And whatever you do in word or deed, _do_ all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him." (Colossians 3:16–17)

How can work or leisure be worship?


## Closing

Your body, your work, your words, your worship—offered up daily in spirit and in truth. When everything becomes worship, nothing is wasted. Every breath becomes an offering.

Is your life a pleasing sacrifice to God?

What's on that altar? Is it pleasing to Him? Are you speaking His love language?

What's not on the altar that should be?
