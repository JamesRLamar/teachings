title: Simplicity Treasure in Heaven

**Matthew 6**

Three times Jesus mentions the secret place and things that should be done in secret:

1. Acts of random kindness
2. Prayer
3. Fasting

**Matthew 6:4**
and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.

"Secret" (Kryptos) - that which is inward and private

"Openly" - to make known outwardly or externally

After teaching about these three things that ought to be done in secret, He commands us not to store treasure on earth, but in heaven.

**Matthew 6:19-20**

Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.

**Matthew 6:21**
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

**Matthew 19:21**

Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”

**Matthew 6:25**

Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?

**Luke 12:15**

And He said to them, “Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.”

**Mark 4:18-19**

Now these are the ones sown among thorns; they are the ones who hear the word, and the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

**Matthew 19:23-24**

Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”

**Do you agree with Jesus' teaching? Do you believe He is right that the Life He promises is hindered by wealth not helped by it?**

If you’re not on board with Jesus’ view of money, it could be that you, like many Christians in the West (myself included until quite recently and with frequent relapses), don’t actually believe the gospel of the kingdom...It could be that you believe another gospel. Another vision of what the good life is and how you obtain it. Let’s call it "the gospel of America."

- Comer, John Mark. The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry (p. 179)

One Wall Street banker said this: We must shift America from a needs to a desires culture…. People must be trained to desire, to want new things, even before the old have been entirely consumed. We must shape a new mentality. Man’s desires must overshadow his needs.9 Sound like an evil genius from an Orwellian sci-fi movie? Nah. That was Paul Mazur of Lehman Brothers. E. S. Cowdrick, a pioneer of “industrial relations,” called it “the new economic gospel of consumption.” Note his language: “gospel.”

- Comer, John Mark. The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry (p. 182)

After the war, it was actually Freud’s nephew, Edward Bernays, who first used Freud’s ideas in America. An intelligence officer during the war, he found himself in need of a job. His theory was that if the Nazis could manipulate people in wartime, then surely business owners and politicians could manipulate people in peacetime. He called his new idea “public relations” and became the so-called “father of American advertising.”14 Never heard of him? Most haven’t. He predicted as much in his book Propaganda: The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of…. In almost every act of our daily lives…we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons…who pull the wires which control the public mind.

**The conclusion of Matthew 6, Jesus says in verse 24:**

No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

**And right after Jesus makes that statement he connects worship to worry in verse 25:**

Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life...

We worry about what we worship.

- Comer, John Mark. The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry (p. 197)

Just like we talked about last week with silence, solitude, and Sabbath; Simplicity must be earned and fought for. The forces of this world are set against us. They war against our soul and long for us to return to that timeless worship of Mammon instead of the simple yoke Jesus asks us to carry.
