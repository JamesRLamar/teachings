4. Remember to smile
5. Remember to give thanks to the Lord for His mercy endures forever

1. **Remember to tinker**

Like elves in Santa’s workshop, make your office not just a workshop but a tinker shop. Learn to find joy in the work of your hands, and don’t take yourself or your results so seriously that they rob you of peace.

2. **Remember to dance**

Seriously, dancing and singing before the Lord sets your heart free to be like a child and release the burden of boring. This is both practical and spiritual. Feeling down? Command your soul to praise the Lord and see how much longer that lasts. I dare you!

3. **Remember to selah**

Pause. Be still. Silence! Slow down enough to reflect and hear the voice of God. He is very likely speaking. We just need to be able to hear so we can obey. “Checketh thyself beforeth thy wrecketh thyself”. While you’re stopping, smell the roses. He likes to do that with you too :)

4. **Remember to smile**

After you’ve remembered to do everything above, cast away any remaining expectations you have on yourself, life, God or anything else and just smile. Smile even if you don’t presently feel it. Smile because there is reason to smile and you know that.

5. **Remember to give thanks to the Lord for His mercy endures forever**

In everything, give thanks. Now you should put your requests before God like statements of thanksgiving knowing He’s got you no matter what. Example, “God, thank you for taking care of my health and heart today. Thank you for working all things together for good in our nation. Thank you for helping me through my troubles by giving me wisdom and favor. Amen"
