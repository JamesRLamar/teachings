"Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?" (Amos 3:3)

I was thinking about that verse during my morning meditation. Have you ever had the thought while meditating, "When am I done?" or "How much should I meditate so my mind is actually renewed?" 

Those are valid questions, and today, I think I have part of the answer. 

We are done meditating once we recognize we agree with the Spirit. 

There are many days when the struggle is real. I read Scripture, remind myself of a wisdom statement, goal, or axiom, and feel my heart push back. It's almost a physical feeling of resisting the truth. 

Like a spoiled child, I can hear my flesh whine, "NO!" with a pouty face. Those are the days I have to buckle down in prayer and meditation. In those moments, I often just confess in honesty, "God, this is not easy, but I want to please You. Help me make up the distance!"

More rarely, but less rarely, as I am faithful to show up every day, I do the same routine of Scripture reading, and my heart just says, "Yep. Amen. Got it. What's next?" It's in those times I know that the Spirit and I agree.

That's when I smile and give thanks for the work He has done in my heart to transform me from the inside out. 

Do you and the Spirit agree today?

Do you feel your heart resisting His counsel?

Have you stayed still in His Presence long enough to crucify the flesh with its desires and fan the flame of the Spirit?
