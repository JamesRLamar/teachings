**Matthew 7:21**

Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.

**Matthew 7:22a**
Many will say to Me in that day...

**What Day is Jesus talking about?**

**Matthew 7:22**

Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’

**Who is Jesus talking about?**

**Matthew 7:23**

And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’

**James 2:8**

If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well

**James 2:9**

but if you show partiality (favoritism), you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.

**James 2:10**

For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.

**James 2:11**

For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.

**James 2:19-20**

You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?

**James 2:24**
You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.

**1 John 1:5**

This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

**1 John 1:6**

If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.

**1 John 1:7**

But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.

**1 John 1:8-9**

If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

**1 John 2:3a**
Now by this we know that we know Him...

**1 John 2:3b**
if we keep His commandments.

**1 John 2:4**

He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

**1 John 2:5**

But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.

**1 John 2:6**
He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.
