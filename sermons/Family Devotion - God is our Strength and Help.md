The word Selah, means to pause and be still. We are going to read it three times in this chapter, so every time we read it let’s take a deep breath and think about the words that were read in a moment of silence. Silence can be awkward, but remember that silence in God’s Presence is a very good thing!

Psalm 46
1 God is our hiding place and source of strength.
    He is an **exceedingly present help** in times of **trouble**.
2 So we are not afraid when the earth quakes
    and the mountains fall into the sea.
3 We are not afraid when the seas become rough and dark
    and the mountains tremble. **Selah**

4 There is a river whose streams bring happiness to God’s city,
    to the holy city of God Most High.
5 God is in that city, so it will never be destroyed.
    He is there to help even before sunrise.
6 Nations will shake with fear and kingdoms will fall
    when God shouts and makes the earth move.
7 The Lord All-Powerful is with us.
    The God of Jacob is our place of safety. **Selah**

8 Look at the powerful things the Lord has done.
    See the awesome things he has done on earth.
9 He stops wars all over the world.

    He breaks the soldiers’ bows, shatters their spears, and burns their shields.

10 God says, “Stop fighting, **Be still**, and know that I am God!
    I am the one who defeats the nations;
    I am the one who controls the world.”
11 The Lord All-Powerful is with us.
    The God of Jacob is our place of safety. **Selah**

**Tell a story about how God has been your help.**

Reread verse 1 and teach about each word in bold. Use the illustration of helping one of the little ones lift a heavy weight. Let them try it by themselves at first, then provide help and make it very easy for them while cheering for them. Then do something similar by having bigger children  push or move one of the smaller children. Then put your hands under their arms and become their hands and have them try again.
