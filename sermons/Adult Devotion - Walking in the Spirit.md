Galatians 5 is one of my favorite Scriptures which so succinctly summarizes the aim of each person who calls upon Yehsua as their Messiah. These verses show such a stark contrast between who we are by old nature and who we are compelled to be by the power of the Spirit and a transformed heart. This word is not a self help “be-a-better-you” kind of admonition, but an evidence-based description of those who simply are or are not fully God’s possession.

“I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish.

Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

‭‭Galatians‬ ‭5:16-17, 19-25‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live in the Spirit, *let us also walk in the Spirit.”*

As challenging as these verses are, some may still have the question, “How do we walk in the Spirit?” Overcomplicating this is easy, but obedience is a simple thing. Obedience is confused only by our foolish attempts to justify our own sinful wishes and desires. The answer to our question, “How do we walk in the Spirit?”, is found in Amos.

Amos 3:3, “Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?”

Question, do you and the Spirit agree?

Do you find yourself arguing about what deserves your attention and affection?

Do your thoughts and emotions align with what He says is true?

Are you better at ignoring the Spirit than faithfully and in child-like fashion simply yielding to the Spirit?

Unless two are agreed, how can they walk together?

Let us take pause to align our thoughts and values and dreams with the One who yearns jealously for our affection and attention. Let us be faithful to love YHWH our God with all our being and leave nothing to be regretted.
