**Genesis 2 ERV**

1 So the earth, the sky, and everything in them were created. God finished the work he was doing, so on the seventh day he rested from his work.

3 God blessed the seventh day and made it a holy day. He made it special because on that day he rested from all the work he did while creating the world.

4 This is the story about the creation of the sky and the earth. This is what happened when the Lord God made the earth and the sky. 5 This was before there were plants on the earth. Nothing was growing in the fields because the Lord God had not yet made it rain on the earth, and there was no one to care for the plants.

8 Then the Lord God planted a garden in a place named Eden. He put the man he made in that garden...The Lord God put the man in the Garden of Eden to work the soil and take care of the garden.

18 Then the Lord God said, “I see that it is not good for the man to be alone. I will make the friend he needs, one just right for him.”

19 The Lord God used dust from the ground and made every animal in the fields and every bird in the air. He brought all these animals to the man, and the man gave them all a name.

20 The man gave names to all the tame animals, to all the birds in the air, and to all the wild animals. He saw many animals and birds, but he could not find a friend that was right for him.

21 So the Lord God caused the man to sleep very deeply. While he was asleep, God took one of the ribs from the man’s body. Then he closed the man’s skin where the rib had been. 22 The Lord God used the rib from the man to make a woman.

25 The man and his wife were naked, but they were not ashamed.

**Matthew 6:26-34 ERV**

26 Look at the birds. They don’t plant, harvest, or save food in barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Don’t you know you are worth much more than they are?

27 You cannot add any time to your life by worrying about it.

28 “And why do you worry about clothes? Look at the wildflowers in the field. See how they grow. They don’t work or make clothes for themselves.

29 But I tell you that even Solomon, the great and rich king, was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers.

30 If God makes what grows in the field so beautiful, what do you think he will do for you? It’s just grass—one day it’s alive, and the next day someone throws it into a fire. But God cares enough to make it beautiful. Surely he will do much more for you. Your faith is so small!

31 “Don’t worry and say, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ That’s what those people who don’t know God are always thinking about. Don’t worry, because your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things.

33 What you should want most is God’s kingdom and doing what he wants you to do. Then he will give you all these other things you need.

34 So don’t worry about tomorrow. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Tomorrow will have its own worries.
