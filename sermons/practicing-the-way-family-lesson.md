**John 14:6** 
Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

**1 John 2:6** (paraphrase)
The person who claims that God lives in their heart should also live their life the same way Jesus did.

**James 1:22**
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.

**Galatians 6:9**
And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.

**Psalm 16:11** 
You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

**Psalm 37:4** 
Delight yourself also in the Lord, And He shall give you the desires of your heart.

**Psalm 27:4** 
One thing I have desired of the Lord, That will I seek: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord All the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the Lord, And to inquire in His temple.

**Isaiah 40:31** 
But those who wait on the Lord Shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint.

[“The Lord is good to those who wait for Him, To the soul who seeks Him. It is good that one should hope and wait quietly For the salvation of the Lord.”
