# Who Is the Spirit to You?

The Ruach HaKodesh (ר֫וּחַ הַקֹּדֶשׁ)—the Holy Spirit—is not an impersonal force but the very breath of God, active in creation, revelation, redemption, and sanctification. He is the promised Comforter (John 14:26), the Spirit of Truth (John 16:13), and the very presence of YHWH dwelling within His people.

The Spirit came in fire at Sinai (Exodus 19:16-19), and again in tongues of fire at Shavuot (Pentecost) in Jerusalem (Acts 2:1-4). He hovered over the waters at creation (Genesis 1:2) and raised Jesus from the dead (Romans 8:11).

## The Promise of the Spirit


> “So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord, and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tabernacle. Then the Lord came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and placed the same upon the seventy elders; and it happened, **when the Spirit rested upon them**, that **they prophesied**, although they never did so again.” (Numbers 11:24–25)

>“Oh, that all the Lord’s people were prophets and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!” (Numbers 11:29)

>“And it shall come to pass afterward That I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your old men shall dream dreams, Your young men shall see visions." (Joel 2:28)

>“Tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.”  (Luke 24:49)

>“When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.”  (Acts 2:1-4)

# Do You Have His Spirit?

> “In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth... having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.”  (Ephesians 1:13)

> “Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.”  (Romans 8:9)

# If You Have His Spirit, Are You Listening to Him or Are You Grieving Him?

> “And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.”  (Ephesians 4:30)

> “But they rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit; So He turned Himself against them as an enemy, and He fought against them.”  (Isaiah 63:10)

Grieving the Spirit occurs through unrepentant sin, resisting His voice, and walking in the flesh rather than in obedience (Galatians 5:16-17).

# If You Are Listening to His Spirit, Are You Hearing Him?

> “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”  (Revelation 2:7)

If you are not hearing Him, your heart may need to be reawakened through sacred practices.

# If Not, the Answer Is the Same as If You Don't Have His Spirit at All

## 1. Pray

### Are you praying with sin?

>"Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much." (James 5:16)

>“One who turns away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.” (Proverbs‬ ‭28‬:‭9)

### Are you praying with the expectation of good?

> “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.  
> But let him ask in **faith**, with **no doubting**, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.  
> For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.” (James 1:5–7)

> “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”  (Luke 11:13)

### Are you praying with energy?

> "...The effective, fervent **(energeō)**  prayer of a righteous man avails much."  (James 5:16)

### Are you praying with power?

> “But you shall receive power **(dynamis)**  when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me…”  (Acts 1:8)

- **Energeō** describes **what happens** when God's power is **at work** within us.
- **Dynamis** is the **power source**—the **Holy Spirit Himself**—who makes that activity possible.

> "Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the **power** **(dynamis)** that **works** **(energeō)** in us..." (Ephesians 3:20)

- Paul links **God’s power (dynamis)** with it **actively working (energeō)** in believers.
    
> "...striving according to His **working** **(energeō)** which **works** **(energeō)** in me **mightily** **(dynamis)** ." (Colossians 1:29)

- Paul labors not in his own strength but by the **energizing** of the Spirit’s **power**.

## 2. Fast

> “As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, ‘Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul...’”  (Acts 13:2)

Fasting clears the channel of the soul so that the Spirit's voice is heard again.

## 3. Seek

> “And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.”  (Jeremiah 29:13)

## 4. Wait

> “But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength...”  (Isaiah 40:31)  

> “Tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.”  (Luke 24:49)

## 5. Trust

> “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”  (Luke 11:13)

> “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.”  (Proverbs 3:5-6 )
