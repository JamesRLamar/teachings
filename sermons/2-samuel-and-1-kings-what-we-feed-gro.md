***Family Emphasis***
**Review last week’s main point:**
People look at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.** **

Illustration of the big gift vs the tiny gift. What was in each gift? Which one looked more valuable on the outside?

“But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have refused him. For the LORD does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”

‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭16:7‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

**This week’s main point:**

What we feed grows stronger. Our hearts are like soil in which we plant and water seeds and then eventually reap what we have sown. Let’s look at the hearts of three different kings.

**Scriptures to read:**

The heart of Saul:

Remember our reading from 1Samuel 15, Saul sinned before God but offering sacrifice instead of being obedient. And when Samuel confronted Saul, he said he was afraid of men and wanted Samuel to honor him in front of the elders in spite of his sin.

The heart of Absolom:

In 2 Samuel 15, we learn that While at Jerusalem, Absalom built support for himself against his father David, by speaking to those who came to King David for justice, saying, “See, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you...If only I were the judge of the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice." He made gestures of flattery by kissing those who bowed before him instead of accepting supplication. He "stole the hearts of the people of Israel".

Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a pillar which is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to preserve my name.” So he named the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day.

2 SAMUEL 18:18

The heart of David:

“And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.’ From this man’s seed, according to the promise, God raised up for Israel a Savior—Jesus—”

‭‭Acts‬ ‭13:21-23 NKJV

Then David danced before the Lord with all his might; and David was wearing a linen ephod. So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.

II Samuel 6:14-15

The reward of David:

So David went on and became great, and the Lord God of hosts was with him.
II Samuel 5:10

The reward of Absolom:

'When a certain man saw it, he told Joab and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.” Now Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. For Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak. And his head caught fast in the oak, so he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him kept going. '

2 SAMUEL 18:9-10

The reward of Saul:

“So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that same day.

So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines, to proclaim it in the temple of their idols and among the people. Then they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.”

‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭31:6, 8-10‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

# Questions:

What kinds of things did Absolom and Saul love?

What kind of things did David love?

What was the difference between these three kings and how their lives ended?

**Illustration**:

Two plants. Have two pots and two plants. Have the pots labeled “Spirit” the other labeled “Sin”. Have the children write down things that would feed either our spirit or our sinful nature and put those pieces of paper into the different pots. Take turns pulling the “seeds” out of the pots and reading them and explaining why that seed would feed our Spirit or else our Sin.

***Adult Emphasis***

# **Scriptures to read:**

2 Samuel 11

# Questions:

Why was David not out to war?
Why was David wandering around alone on the roof of his palace at night?
What was David busy NOT doing?
What part of himself did he feed when this cascade of sin occurred?

From last week:
How can we hear the voice of God?

- Be still
- Be quiet
- Be humble and repentant
- Fast
- Meditate on His Word and Promises
- Seek counsel from trusted sources
- Then wait until we feel His peace and discern His will
