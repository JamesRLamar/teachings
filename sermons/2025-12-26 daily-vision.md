I want to teach a lesson based on this concept. 

Too many Christian’s have no vision for their life. They have goals but they don’t renew their minds with those goals. Many want to know God, to love Him well, to love others well, to put first things first. But they are so easily distracted in the troubles of today they make no provision for what matters most tomorrow.

Many of us want a beautiful harvest, but we don’t sow the right seeds each day. We pray for God’s will to be done in our lives, yet make no room in our calendars for His presence.

“How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives” is by Annie Dillard, an American author and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer.

It takes 5 minutes to pray for every person you know well. It takes 3 minutes to read carefully through a meaningful meditation. 

If we don’t put God first in our day, what place is He in our lives?

Exodus 20:2. The first commandment. 

If there are other things that “come before” God, what is that called?

Priority means what comes before. 

How are you sowing? Better questions, how are you reaping? What you are reaping rig by now tells be what you sowed yesterday. 

## Practical Daily Vision

**Relationships**:  
- Vision: **To walk closely with my God.** 
- Questions: Have I spent quality time with Him today? Have I slowed down enough to hear His voice? 
- Vision: **To love my wife like Jesus loves the Church. To raise up my daughters to be prophetesses.** 
- Questions: Have I spent quality time with my family today? Have I communicated my appreciation to them? Have I guarded my heart and my reputation?
- Vision: **To make devoted disciples ready for Judgment Day.**
- Questions: Have I prayed for each of person in my circles today? Have I cast vision and spent time equipping them this week?

**Physical and Mental Health**:  
- Vision: **To be strong and healthy. To be whole and happy.** 
- Questions: Is this food choice good for my brain and body? Did I exercise or do active recovery today? Did I deep breathe and meditate when I felt tired?

**Work**:  
- Vision: **To find joy in my work and minimize its impact on what matter most. To be light in the darkness.**

**Financial Health**:  
- Vision: **To be a faithful and generous steward.**
- Questions: Is this purchase within my budget? 

- Did I protect the best part of my day to write, or did I give God my leftovers?
