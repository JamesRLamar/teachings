# The Day of Trumpets

## Introduction
**Question:** How many of you think the first day of school is important? Why?

**Analogy:** Imagine your teacher tells you that in 7 months, you'll have the most crucial test of the year. Pass, and you graduate; fail, and you're out. 

**Question:** How would you prepare for such a day?

## God's Calendar
**Question:** Do you know what a holiday is? 

**Activity:** Let's talk about holidays like Christmas and the 4th of July. What do they mean to you?

**Point:** Just like these holidays, God has His own special days, and they're even more important. The Feast of Trumpets is one of them.

## What Does 'Holy' Mean?
**Question:** What does the word 'holy' mean to you?

**Explanation:** 'Holy' means set apart for God. God's holy days are special because they not only remind us of past events but also warn us of future events./

## The Feast of Trumpets: A Warning
**Point:** The Feast of Trumpets is a warning about the final judgment day.

**1 Thessalonians 4:16:** "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first." 

**1 Thessalonians 4:17:** "Then we who are alive _and_ remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord." 

**Question:** What do you think will happen on that day?

## The 100 Trumpet Blasts

1. **Wake Up!** - Short, annoying blasts
2. **Repent!** - Three short, descending, broken blasts
3. **Rise from the Dead!** - Nine very short, alarming blasts
4. **Judgment is Now!** - One long siren-sounding blast

**Question:** Why do you think these blasts are important?

## Watching for the Moon
**Point:** The Feast of Trumpets starts when the moon appears for the 7th time on God's calendar.

**Activity:** Starting this Friday, look for the moon. When you see it, tell your parents and then you can bust open your piñatas!

## Heart Check

**Scripture:** "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me." (Psalm 51:10)

**Question:** What should be in our hearts when Yeshua comes back?

**Point**: This coming weekend, on the Feast of Trumpets, we don't know for sure, but we know that Yeshua could come back and judge the earth. So we need to be asking God to forgive us and make our hearts perfectly clean.

**Activity:** Construct and decorate your own trumpet piñatas. When you spot the moon, you can bust them open to find a trumpet and candy inside!
