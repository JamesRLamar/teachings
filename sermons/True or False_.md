**What are some of the qualities of the False Church of the End Times?**

**2 Timothy 3:1-5**

But know this, that in the last days hard times shall come. For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of silver, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, thankless, wrong-doers, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, haters of good, betrayers, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of Elohim, having a form of reverence but denying its power. And turn away from these!

**Matthew 7:21-23**

Not everyone who says to Me, "Lord, Lord," shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?" And then I will declare to them, "I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!"

**What does this prophecy predict about the Church in the Last Days?**

**1 Kings 18:17-24**

17 And it came to be, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, “Is that you, O disturber of Israel?”

18 And he answered, “I have not disturbed Israel, but you and your father’s house, in that you have forsaken the commands of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals."

19 And now, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Karmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of Ashĕrah, who eat at Jezebel's table.”

20 And Elijah came to all the people, and said, “How long would you keep hopping between two opinions? If Yahweh is Elohim, follow Him; and if Baal, follow him.” But the people answered him not a word.

22 And Elijah said to the people, “I alone am left a prophet of Yahweh, but the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men. “Now let them give us two bulls. And let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but set no fire. And I, I prepare the other bull, and shall lay it on the wood, but set no fire. “And you shall call on the name of your mighty one, and I, I call on the Name of Yahweh. And the Elohim who answers by fire, He is Elohim.” So all the people answered and said, “The word is good.”

**Revelation 18:4**

And I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues."

**Exodus 20:7**

You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.

**Psalm 19:14**
14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
Be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.
