title: Five Love Languages of God Quality Time
---




1. God is our source of life
2. God delights in your time
3. The Sabbath is His day
4. Your greatest treasure is your time

## 1. God is Our Source of Life

**Isaiah 30:15**
For thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel: “In returning and rest you shall be saved; In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.” But you would not.

**Returning** - to repent or return to your point of origin

**Backslide** - the opposite of "returning," which means to wander, walk away, or fall away

**Hosea 11:7**
My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High, None at all exalt Him.

**Matthew 11:28-29**  
Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

## 2. God Delights in Your Time

**Luke 10:38-42**
But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.

**James 4:8**  
Draw near to God and He will draw near to you.

**Psalm 73:25–28** TS2009
25 Whom do I have in the heavens? And I have desired no one besides You on earth. 

26 My flesh and my heart shall waste away, But Elohim is the rock of my heart And my portion forever. 

27 For look, those who are far from You perish; You shall cut off all those Who go whoring away from You. 

28 But as for me, it is good to be near Elohim. I have made my refuge in the Lord Yahweh, To declare all Your works.

## 3. The Sabbath is His Day

**Exodus 20:8-10**  
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work…

**Isaiah 58:13–14**
13 If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, From doing your pleasure on My holy day, And call the Sabbath a delight, The holy day of Yahweh honorable, And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, Nor finding your own pleasure, Nor speaking your own words, 

14 Then you shall delight yourself in Yahweh; And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth, And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father. The mouth of the Lord has spoken.

**Hebrews 4:9–10** (The Scriptures)
9 So there remains a Sabbath-keeping for the people of Elohim. 

10 For the one, having entered into His rest, has himself also rested from his works, as Elohim rested from His own.

## 4. Your Greatest Treasure is Your Time

### **Matthew 6:19-21**
Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
