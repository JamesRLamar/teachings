title: Light is a symbol of hope and the presence of God

Light is a symbol of hope and the presence of God.

Darkness is a symbol of despair, fear, and the absence of good.

God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

When God is with you it is not possible me for there not to be an expectation of good. Only good can come from His favor.
