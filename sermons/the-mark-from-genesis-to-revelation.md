**Revelation 18:1-4**

After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated with his glory. And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird!

And I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, **my people**, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues...

Revelation is a coalescing of all of Scripture and Prophecy. We see the same symbols and characters in Revelation as we do in Exodus.

Pharaoh is a type of _____________ or ______________.

Israel is ________________.

God's people are persecuted but spared from ________________.

Three things stand out about God's people:
1. They only worship the God called ________________
2. They cease from work on ________________
3. They observe the feast of ________________ every year

**Exodus 3:10**

Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring **My people**, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

**Exodus 3:14-15**

And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’ ” Moreover God said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘The Yahuweh God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name **forever**, and this is My memorial to **all generations**.’

**Exodus 4:31**

So the people believed; and when they heard that the Yahuweh had visited the children of Israel and that He had looked on their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.

**Exodus 5:1-2 **

And afterwards Moses and Aaron went in and said to Pharaoh, “Thus said Yahuweh Elohim of Israel, ‘Let My people go, so that they celebrate a festival to Me in the wilderness.’ ” And Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahuweh, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know Yahuweh, nor am I going to let Israel go.”

**Exodus 5:5**

And Pharaoh said, “See, the people of the land are many now, and you make them **cease** from their burdens!”

**Exodus 5:9**

Let more work be laid on the men, so that they labour in it, and not pay attention to words of falsehood.

| **Plagues of Exodus** | **Plagues of Revelation** |
| Nile River turned to blood | Revelation 8:8, Then the second angel sounded: And something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.<br>Revelation 16:3, Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living creature in the sea died. |

For in one hour she is made desolate."<br>Revelation 6:8, So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him.

**Revelation 13:16-18**

He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. **Let him who has understanding** calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.

**Exodus 13:8-10**

And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, ‘This is done because of what Yahuweh did for me when I came up from Egypt.’ **It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes**, that the Yahuweh’s law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahuweh has brought you out of Egypt. You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its **season** from year to year.

**Exodus 13:15-16**

And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that Yahuweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahuweh all males that open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ **It shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes**, for by strength of hand Yahuweh brought us out of Egypt.

**Deuteronomy 6:4-8**

Hear, O Israel: Yahuweh our God, Yahuweh is one! You shall love Yahuweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.

“And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. **You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.**

**Exodus 16:4-5**

Then Yahuweh said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in **My law** or not. And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”

**Exodus 16:27-30**

Now it happened that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none. And Yahuweh said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep **My commandments and My laws**? See! For Yahuweh has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.” So the people rested on the seventh day.

**Exodus 31:13-17**

Speak also to the children of Israel, saying: Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, **for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations**, that you may know that I am the Yahuweh who sanctifies you. You shall keep the Sabbath, therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.

Work shall be done for six days, but the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Yahuweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath **throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant**. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel **forever**; for in six days the Yahuweh made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.

**Acts 13:42-44**

So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath...On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.

**Acts 15:12-21**

Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring how many miracles and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles. And after they had become silent, James answered, saying, “Men and brethren, listen to me: Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them **a people for His name**. **And with this the words of the prophets agree**, just as it is written:

After this I will return
And will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down;
I will rebuild its ruins,
And I will set it up;
So that the rest of mankind may seek Yahuweh,
Even all the Gentiles who are called by My name,
Says Yahuweh who does all these things.

Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God, but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and from blood. For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.
