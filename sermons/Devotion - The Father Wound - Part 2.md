When we first talked about [The Father Wound](https://www.evernote.com/l/AF-xVZ2ZrdVB2LguvbwLsk0P65cJtS5nB5I) I explained how early childhood experience shapes our perspective or the script we tell ourselves again and again.

Perspective is everything!

Our perspective of God and our perspective of ourselves

**What good is our belief in God if we do not hope and trust in him?**

**What good is it to meditate if you do not truly believe in God who works all things together for good?**

You are a priority to God! If you do not let sink in you will never openly approach God. You will keep him at a distance because you believe He keeps you at a distance.

**What are the symptoms of believing God is distant?**

**How might that perspective affect your relationships? Your contentment? Your prayers?**

**What are the symptoms of believing that you are NOT a priority?**

**2 Samuel 4:4**

Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.

**Who were the enemies that Mephibosheth was fleeing from?**

**Sometimes God will break you to prepare you.**

**2 Samuel 9**

1 Now David said, “Is there still anyone who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”

6 Now when Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself. Then David said, “Mephibosheth?” And he answered, “Here is your servant!”

7 So David said to him, “Do not fear, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.”

8 Then he bowed himself, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I?”

9 And the king restored to Mephibosheth everything that was Saul’s and made it so that he would eat bread at David's table always.

**A couple things to point out before we read Psalm 23:**
Shepherds carried a rod that was used for several purposes.

- As a weapon against predators
- As a hook to keep the sheep from wandering away
- As a rod to break the legs of lost sheep who refused to lie down

Sheep are notoriously easily annoyed and aggravated when it comes to their ears. If a sheep is bothered by flies in the ears, they will bang their heads against a rock till it kills itself. To avoid this tragedy, the shepherd will anoint their heads with essential oils to prevent the flies from swarming them. Anointing the head also represents divine appointment just like when David’s head was anointed by the prophet Samuel when God chose him as king. Every sheep is anointed.

**Psalm 23**
1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

2 He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters.

3 He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake.

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil;

For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over.

6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

The name Mephibosheth means “to shatter shame”. Whatever your low opinion of yourself may be, God wants to shatter your shame. He wants to restore you, anoint you, promote you, love you, cherish you, walk with you, hold you and never let go of you. He wants you to eat at His table always.
