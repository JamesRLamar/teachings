**What should Mark us as followers of Christ?**

**Jehovah's Witnesses**

- Jehovah's Witnesses believe their denomination is a restoration of first-century Christianity.
- They believe the name of God is based on the Tetragrammaton יהוה
- Their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation, in which God gradually reveals his will and purpose, results from the application of reason and study, the guidance of the holy spirit, and direction from Jesus Christ and angels.
- They consider all other present-day religions to be false, identifying them with "Babylon the Great", or the "harlot", of Revelation 17 and believe the United Nations will play a part in End Times.
- The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired, inerrant word of God.
- Jehovah's Witnesses consider the Bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliable and interpret much of it literally, but accept parts of it as symbolic.
- Regular personal Bible reading is frequently recommended;
- Witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and "private ideas" reached through Bible research independent of Watch Tower Society publications, and are cautioned against reading other religious literature.
- Adherents are told to have "complete confidence" in the leadership, avoid skepticism about what is taught in the Watch Tower Society's literature, and "not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to Bible understanding."
- The organization makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all Witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements.

**1 Corinthians 13:1-8 NKJV**

1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.

2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.

4 Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, **is not puffed up**;

5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

8 Love never fails.

**1 Corinthians 8 NKJV and Para**

1 Now concerning things offered to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. **Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies**.

2 And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.

3 But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.

4 Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one. For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live.

7 However, not everyone has that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, eat the food as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

8 But food does not make us right to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.

9 But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.

10 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols?

11 And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?

12 But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

13 Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.

**1 Corinthians 2:4-5 NKJV**

And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of **human**  **wisdom**, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith should not be in the **wisdom of men** but in the power of God.
