title: Devotion Ten Commandments Do not bear false wi
---


Test the children to see if they can quote all Ten Commandments. Make sure they remember the command not to bear false witness or steal. Explain how this commandment is not just about not lying, it’s about telling the full truth and standing up for the truth.

Do not **bear** false testimony. Even allowing something false to be said in your presence about someone else is breaking this commandment. We must learn to defend truth in all situations. It’s not just about us lying or not lying.

**Lie:** I ate my vegetables, when you ate none
**Half-lie:** I ate my vegetables, when you only ate some of them
**Half-truth: **there is no such thing

**Standing for truth:** mom sees your plate empty and says “good job eating your vegetables” when you didn’t

Gossip is another example of standing for truth, when we speak up for others not present

[Genesis 25:22-34](https://my.bible.com/bible/406/GEN.25.22-26) ERV

22 While Rebekah was pregnant, the babies inside her struggled with one another. She prayed to the Lord and said, “What is happening to me?” 23 The Lord said to her, “The leaders of two nations are in your body. Two nations will come from you, and they will be divided. One of them will be stronger, and the older will serve the younger.” 24 When the right time came, Rebekah gave birth to twins. 25 The first baby was red. His skin was like a hairy robe. So he was named Esau. 26 When the second baby was born, he was holding tightly to Esau’s heel. So that baby was named Jacob.

Tell in summary the story of Esau selling his inheritance to Jacob for a bowl of soup.

[Genesis 27:1-40 ](https://my.bible.com/bible/406/GEN.27.1-40)

Tell in summary the story of Jacob deceiving his father into giving him Esau’s blessing.

[Genesis 27:36](https://my.bible.com/bible/406/GEN.27.36) ERV

Esau said, “His name is Jacob. That is the right name for him. He has tricked me twice. He took away my rights as the firstborn son. And now he has taken away my blessing.” Then Esau said, “Have you saved any blessing for me?”

Why did Jacob lie and steal?

God told Rebekah that Esau would one day serve Jacob, but that they would both be great nations.

Has Jacob lived up to his name?

Jacob ends up running away from home because his brother wanted to kill him Jacob ends up being tricked and cheated multiple times by this uncle Laban. During that time Jacob learned how much it hurts when people we trust lie to us and steal from us. But if Jacob would have just trusted God, then God would have found a way to give Jacob all Je promised without him having to learn so many hard lessons.

What’s the only thing we are born into this world with? A name

What’s the only thing we are leaving this work with? What name means based our the life we have lived

Proverbs 22:1
A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches,
Loving favor rather than silver and gold.
