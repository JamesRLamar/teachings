**The take away point: The words we speak matter and have the power to bring life or death. **

Open with the Shema

Ask:Â  Do you think the words you speak matter? Like do they have meaning or are they just words? If I called myself stupid do you think that matters?

Ask: Can you give me some examples of kind words or ways to encourage someone? What about hurtful words or ways to discourage someone?

Proverbs 15:1 ERV: "A gentle answer makes anger disappear, but a rough answer makes it grow."

THINK METHOD:
TRUE, HONORABLE, INSPIRING, NECESSARY, KIND

Object Lesson:

Proverbs 18:21 ESV: "The tongue can speak words that bring life or death. Those who love to talk must be ready to accept what it brings."

Proverbs 16:24 ERV: "Kind words are like honey; they are easy to accept and good for your health."

Remember to use the THINK method if you are unsure of the words you want to speak.
