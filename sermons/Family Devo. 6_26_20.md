Ask kids to help recap the last few weeks.

Last week was about the breast plate of righteousness. Can any one re-call the definition of righteousness? (To be free from guilt or sin)

Does anyone remember the first piece of armor we talked about a few weeks ago?

(The belt of truth) and what exactly is that?

Jesus says in John 14:6 I am the way the Truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me.

So he is the first part of the armor we need to put on.

Does anyone know what part of the armor we are talking about today?
 The shoes / boots for our feet.
What would happen to a soldier if he was wearing flip flops in a battle?

Let’s read:
1. “Finally, receive your power from the Lord and from his mighty strength.

2. Put on all the armor that God supplies. In this way you can take a stand against the devil’s strategies.

3. This is not a wrestling match against a human opponent. We are wrestling with rulers, authorities, the powers who govern this world of darkness, and spiritual forces that control evil in the heavenly world.

4. For this reason, take up all the armor that God supplies. Then you will be able to take a stand during these evil days. Once you have overcome all obstacles, you will be able to stand your ground.

5. So then, take your stand! Fasten truth around your waist like a belt. Put on God’s Righteousness as your breastplate.

6. ==Put on your shoes so that you are ready to spread the Good News that gives peace. ==

‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭6:10-15‬ ‭GW‬‬

Does anyone know what the number one fear is from the beginning of time up to this present day?

What is the good news that gives peace?

(The fact that Jesus came to this earth and died in our place so we can live with God in heaven forever.)

 Should this give us peace in this world when we are sick? or have no money? or natural disasters? Or trials in our lives?
