---


**The takeaway points:**

- We should honor the name of Yahweh and not dishonor it, or make it useless.

Do: Name the 10 commandments.

My Response: Today we will be focusing our lesson on Commandment number 3, Do not take God's name in Vain

Kid's Read
**Exodus 20:7**

You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.

Watch Bible Project Video on God's Name:

We already learned 2 from the video, Yahweh means "I AM" & Adonai meaning "LORD GOD"

Kid's Read
**Genesis 22:13-14 NKJV**

" Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind *him*  *was* a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son. And Abraham called the name of the place, The-Lord-Will-Provide; as it is said *to* this day, “In the Mount of the Lord it shall be provided.”

The name for God that means "The LORD will provide" is Jehovah Jireh.

Kid's Read
**Exodus 15:26 ERV**

He said to him, “I am the Lord your God. If you listen to me and do what I say is right, and if you obey all my commands and laws, then I will not give you any of the sicknesses that I gave the Egyptians. I am the Lord who heals you"

The name of God that means "God who heals" is Jehovah Rapha.

So with that in mind let's look at the 3rd commandment: "Do not take God's name in vain".

Vain means: producing no result, useless

So obeying this command is done by both the words we speak and the actions in our lives. So when we use the names of God we are using them in an honorable and respectful manner, but also when we take on God's name, and call ourselves a "Child of God" how we are living our everyday lives need to be honorable and respectful to God.
