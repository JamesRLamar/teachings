**3 Things Teaching is NOT:**
1. Teaching is NOT to be taken lightly
2. Teaching is NOT easy
3. Teaching is NOT to be desired

**James 3:1**

My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment.

**MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHING**
**Never teach something unless it meets all these requirements:**
1. You know it well
2. You believe it wholeheartedly
3. You practice it faithfully
4. You've been genuinely changed by it

In the end, if you spend five minutes talking about something that meets the criteria above, you will have done well and planted a seed that will one day bear fruit

- Teaching can be simple, but it's not to be prepared for flippantly
- Teaching can be fun, but it should not be taken lightly
- Teaching can be rewarding, but it opens up spiritual warfare you need to be prepared for

**Principles to Sharpen Your Teaching Skills**

- First, pray
- Second, listen
- Third, if your message doesn't meet the **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHING** above, repeat steps 1 and 2
- Answer the question “Why should I listen?” at the very beginning and repeat it at the end
    - Some studies show people will not listen unless you give them a compelling reason to listen in the first 8 seconds.
- Have one main theme you want people to remember and focus everything you say towards that one point
- Begin with the end in mind, show them the final result, or tell them your ultimate goal in teaching that lesson
    - For example, "I want you to be inspired to pray every day this week"
- Both dialogue and monologue help people learn
    - Invite questions and feedback
    - Ask people to explain in their own words
- Remember your audience
    - Teach towards the youngest person in your audience
    - Use examples everyone understands
    - Use words everyone knows or else take time to explain words you think they may not know

- Part of teaching is teaching people how to learn and discern on their own
    - Demonstrate how to study and interpret the Bible
- Cut out the fat
    - Communicate only what is essential to understanding your main point
    - "Pet" points belong outside while teaching, don't bring them into the conversation. Nobody thinks your pet is as cute as you do. It's awkward
- Offer notes for people who want to review
    - Some people also follow better with tactile paper notes
- Focus on the mission
    - Don't approach teaching flippantly
    - Consider that this may be the only or the last teaching they will hear
    - Believe what you teach
- Focus on the message
    - Don't go chasing rabbit trails
    - Learn to guide people back or actively pin conversations for after the lesson
    - Rabbit trails **will** take away from the message and the mission
- Keep it simple
    - Say this three times while clicking your heels
    - If you find yourself feeling stuck under analysis paralysis, ask yourself these questions, and if the answer is affirmative, move on with what you have or build on what you find effective
        - Am I keeping it simple?
        - Is what I have good enough?
        - Do I make at least one important point for people to practice or remember?
- Be yourself, everyone else is taken
- Teach what God has taught you. You are only there to plant or water seeds that have bore fruit in your own life
- Talking is not teaching. Focus your words and remember the parable of the large field with only 30 minutes to sow
    - If you had a large field to plant, but only 30 minutes to do so, would you rather scatter as much seed as possible and hope for the best, or take your time to effectively plant and water many fewer seeds? When teaching, choose the latter
- Practice, practice, practice
    - On yourself, not on other people
    - Record yourself, you'll probably hate it, but it will make you better
- At the end, have a clear call to action
