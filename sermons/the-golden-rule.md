(All verses are paraphrase)

**Matthew 7:12**

Think about how you want people to treat you. Then make sure you treat them the way you want to be treated. The message of the entire Bible comes down to this simple rule.

**How do you want to be treated?**

**Matthew 7:13**

Choose the narrow path in life; for wide is the door and broad is the path that leads to death, and there are many people who take the wide path.

**Matthew 7:14**

Many people take the wide path because the way of life is narrow and difficult, and there are very few people who choose it.

**Matthew 7:15**

Beware of false people, who come to you dressed like innocent sheep, but inside they are hungry wolves.

**Matthew 7:16**

You will know people by their fruit. Do we get apples from thorn bushes or oranges from poison ivy?

**Matthew 7:17-18**

So every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.

**Matthew 7:19**
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

**Matthew 7:20**
Therefore you will know people by their fruit.
