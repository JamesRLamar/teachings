**Striving**
**What do you think about when you hear the word "Striving"?**

**Titus 3:9 **

But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and useless.

**Ecclesiastes 2:24 **

Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor (striving).  This also, I saw, was from the hand of God.

**Luke 10:40**

But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me."

**Luke 10:41-42**

And Jesus answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.”

**Surrender**
**What does surrendering look like?**

**Titus 3:5-8 TS2009**

“He saved us, not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His compassion, through the washing of rebirth, and renewal by the Set-apart Spirit, which He poured out on us richly through Yeshua  Messiah our Saviour, that having been declared right by His favour we should become heirs according to the expectation of everlasting life. Trustworthy is the word, and in this regard I wish you to strongly affirm, that those who have believed in Elohim should keep their minds on maintaining good works. This is good and profitable to men.”

**Colossians 3:23-24**

And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.

**Philippians 4:16-27**

Be anxious for nothing, but through prayer and supplication with thanksgiving; let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your heart and mind in Messiah Yeshua.

**Psalm 46:10**
NKJV - Be still, and know that I am God...
NASB - Stop striving and know that I am God...

**Learning to be Loved. Surrender to God's love for you!**

We need to learn to be loved by God. It sounds like it should be so easy, yet in reality it is difficult. Many of us have deep wounds from our past that cause us to close off ourselves. When we begin a relationship with God, or anyone, we have to learn how to be loved.

We have to learn to let down our walls and be vulnerable. If we have a tangible person in front of us, it is easier to be loved. But trying to let God Love us, whom we can't see, is hard. That’s why we meditate on His words and trust they are true. We must believe that what he says is truth and allow ourselves completely receive that love.

**Hebrews 11:6**

But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.
