- Don't overestimate the task in front of you and underestimate the God who called you to it.
- Don't fret over the trial you face and forget the One who walks with you through the fire.
- Don't magnify the mountain and minimize the Messiah.

**Philippians 4:4-5 NKJV**

Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice! Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.

**Philippians 4:6-7 NKJV**

Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

**Philippians 4:8 NKJV**

Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthyâ€”meditate on these things.

**Philippians 4:9 NKJV**

The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do, and the God of peace will be with you.

**Philippians 4:11-13 TS2009**

Not that I speak concerning need, for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am. I know what it is to be humbled, and I know what it is to have in excess. In any and every situation I have learned both to be filled, and to be hungry, both to have in excess, and to be in need. I have strength to do all, through Messiah who empowers me.

**Philippians 4:19 NKJV**

And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
