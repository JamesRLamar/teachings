There are some good church communities out there, many of which gather in the traditional way. There are churches where discipleship and loving Jesus are real priorities. And there are churches that put in great effort to accommodate and educate large crowds of people. But why do we do what we do? We could all just attend a regular church like most other people. Why gather in a home? Why endure the "look" when you tell people you attend a house church?

**4 Reasons why we do what we do:**

**1 - With a clear conscience, we need to be able to answer the question, "Where is your treasure?"**

**Matthew 6:21**
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

If we want our treasure to be in what is eternal, then we must invest in what is eternal and reduce what is not. To guard what is forever and cut what is secular, our gathering should be simple and inexpensive to reproduce. We must learn to gather simply and we must all do the work of ministry. We must learn to gather and grow without the context of expensive buildings and professional staff.

**2 - The End is coming and The Foundation matters**

If we actually believe a time is coming when the righteous will be persecuted, not given tax exemption, then we must prepare. If we believe a flood is coming then we must begin building an ark. Building that ark requires an inspired blueprint with specific materials. The Foundation matters, and the materials we use to build matter. Those things we say are critical, must remain critical. Those things which are unreliable or unstable, must not be a part of what gives the structure strength. Our doctrine must be rock solid. Our ears must be sharply tuned to hear the voice of the Spirit. Our hearts must be resolute to endure any temptation or ridicule. And we must make disciples who of the like.

**1 Corinthians 3**

9 For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, you are God’s building.

10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.

11 For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

12 Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each one’s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is.

14 If anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward. If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.

**3 - Jesus is the Cornerstone**

We cannot allow the Church to be built around the talent or personality of any individual except Jesus. To this end, every person must learn to identify and faithfully steward their talents. All spiritual talents should point people to Jesus. Leadership is recognized as those who reliably lead others to Jesus, first and foremost through the example of their own lives. Leadership should not be a corporate hierarchy. EVERYTHING we do must point to Him.

**Matthew 20:25-26**

But Jesus called them to Himself and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them. Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant.

**Ephesians 2:19-20**

Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone

"Don’t be afraid to develop gatherings that will be dull if God doesn’t move.” -- Francis Chan.

**4 - All mature and healthy things must multiply to survive**

**1 Peter 2:5**
You also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house...

**Matthew 28:18-20**

And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.

Every person can commit to 5:3:1. To actively connect to 5 people, be able to challenge 3 of those people, and make a lifelong disciple of at least 1. We must make disciples that will replace us, not require us. But the harvest is not your responsibility, only being faithful to plant and water. We must focus on the family. We want parents to disciple their families well. If we fail at everything else but succeed at that we have accomplished much.
