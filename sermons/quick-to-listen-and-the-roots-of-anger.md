title: Quick to Listen and the Roots of Anger
---




**James 1:19**
My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.

Why should I listen? This topic is essential because it can profoundly affect the state of our soul. Ask yourself, how much does being easily angered affect your quality of life, your quality of relationships, and your quality of decision-making? 

## The Roots of Anger

> One root comes from the impossible expectations we place on ourselves and then project those broken expectations onto others. 

**Proverbs 29:11**
Fools give full vent to their rage, but the wise bring calm in the end.

**Psalm 37:8**
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; Do not fret—it only causes harm.

What kinds of things make us angry towards ourselves?

Do these expectations align with God's grace, or do they reflect perfectionism and a fear of failure?

What kinds of things make us angry towards others?

> Another root of anger comes when we feel trapped. 

What makes feeling trapped feel so overwhelming?

## How to Become Resilient

Resilience is not about pretending as if people's words don't hurt. It's about a mindset toward those words. It's about seeing value in all forms of criticism or truth, even if they're packaged in a painful or less compassionate way. 

**Proverbs 15:31**
Whoever heeds life-giving correction will be at home among the wise.

**Proverbs 9:9**
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

**Illustration**: Imagine that people's constructive but harsh words are like them throwing a pack of dollar bills and hitting you in the face. You might say, "Oh, that hurt. I wish you hadn't delivered it that way, but you gave me much value. I'm going to use this valuable thing." 

**Proverbs 27:6**
Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.

**James 1:2-4**
My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.

> We need to do more than repackage people's words and actions into opportunities for growth. We need to put on armor.

**Ephesians 6:13-17** 
Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day...

What are some practical points we can extract from this armor analogy?

**Illustration**: Have someone put on a football helmet for protection. Ask them to compare the feeling they have when money is thrown at their face with or without the helmet. 

How can focusing on God's promises act as a 'helmet' in trying situations?

## What Can Man Do to Me that God Cannot Remedy?

**Psalm 118:5-6**
I called on the Lord in distress; The Lord answered me and set me in a broad place. The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me?

- Joseph receives a coat of favor followed by dreams that prophecy he will be promoted above his entire family, but his brothers become jealous and seek to kill him.
- Out of convenience, his brothers end up just selling Joseph into slavery, where he is abandoned by all and left with no hope.
- In Egypt, Joseph faithfully served in Potiphar’s house but was falsely accused by Potiphar’s wife and imprisoned. 
- While in prison, Joseph interprets dreams for Pharaoh’s servants and is promised to be remembered but is forgotten.
- Eventually, the Pharaoh recognized Joseph’s wisdom and appointed him as second-in-command over Egypt, but a great famine spread across the land.
- At the height of the famine, Joseph’s brothers come to Egypt seeking food. When Joseph reveals himself to his brothers, he says, “You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good. To bring about this day and the salvation of many.”

**Hebrews 12:2**
Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

## Closing Questions

- Who in my life needs my full attention rather than my quick response?
- Are there areas in my life where my anger stems from unrealistic expectations of myself or others?
- What can I do starting tomorrow to be better prepared for the battles I know will come?
