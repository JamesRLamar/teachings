Leviticus 23:23-32

You Teruah inaugurates Yom Kippur

[Joshua 6:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%206:5&version=NKJV)

It shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, andwhen you hear the sound of the trumpet, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the wall of the city will fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.”

[1 Corinthians 15:52](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:52&version=NKJV)

in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

2 Peter 3:10-13
King James Version

10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,

12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?

13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

Once every 49 years, the last Trump is actually blown on Yom Kippur to announce the year of Jubilee. Jesus may have already fulfilled part Jubilee in Luke 4, but certainly not all of it. For it speaks of a simultaneous event which is a year of the Lord but a Day of Vengeance.

So we may look for the season of Yeshua’s return to fall on a dab it all year but especially a Jubilee year. For the symbols of Jubliee seem to match what we know of eternal life as well. There shall be no sowing or reaping. Everyone shall be made free and everyone shall be called back to their birth homes.
