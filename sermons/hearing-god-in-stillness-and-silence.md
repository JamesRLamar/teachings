title: Devotion Hearing God in Stillness and Silence
---


**Last week we talked about having a vision for a godly life. I challenged you to write your life down.

**A Vision for a Godly Life**

I begin each day by rising first to walk with Him. I start my walk with quiet thanks. I pray as the Lord taught me to pray. Then I begin to worship in song, paying close attention to the meaning of the words. I am careful to keep my focus on Him and guard against distractions. I open my heart and ask God to search me and be kind to sharpen me. I read a small portion of Scripture till I have given my soul some source of encouragement or challenge. Then I begin my work.

As I start my work, I ask God for His help. And I remind myself that what I do today, I do as unto Him not unto them.

In the afternoon, I pause again to give thanks and sing a song of worship. I make myself to be still and breathe deep so I don’t get caught up in the business of the world.

In the evening, we pause as a family in silence and then give thanks before eating dinner together.

**God is found in Stillness and Silence. He is always trying to lead us to the place where He is. **

**Where our physical body is, is of no matter.**
**Where our career is, is of no matter.**
**Where we live is of no matter.**
**Where our soul is, means everything!**

**Exodus 14:13-14 Paraphrase**

And Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of Yehovah, which He will do for you today. For these Egyptians whom you see today, you will never ever see again. Yehovah fights for you, you need only to remain silent."

**1 Kings 19:11-12 NKJV**

Then He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before the Lord.” And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a **still*  *small* voice*.

**Mark 4 NKJV**

35 On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side.” Now when they had left the multitude, they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also with Him. And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?”

39 Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be still!” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.

Where is Jesus?
Not where is he physically, but where is he really?
He is at peace and still

He was in the same boat in the same storm caught in the same trouble, yet he was at peace and he was still.

**Psalm 23 NKJV**
The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.
He *makes* me to lie down in green pastures;
He leads me beside the *still* waters.
He restores my soul;

**What do we need to say “yes” to in order to walk with God?**

- **Rise early**
- **Plan the day**
- **Settle for simple**
- **Fight for focus**

**What do we need to say “no” to in order to walk with God?**

- **Working to please others**
- **Distractions**
- **Good things that aren’t God things**

**What keeps you from being still?**

**What expectations do you entertain that rob you of the life and peace God desires?**

Remember the vision for your life is part of a whole.

Acts 2:42-47

Remember that devotion is not only measured by what you say yes to, but also what you say no to.

Remember the jar and the big rocks. You have to prioritize the big rocks or there won’t be room if you fill it with sand and pebbles. You also have to choose wisely what those big rocks are. Write them down and realize that if you add anything else you must remove one of those other big rocks.
