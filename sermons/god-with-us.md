# God Is With You: The Feast of Tabernacles

> "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory…" (John 1:14)

God's heart has always been to dwell—not merely above us, near us, or around us—but *with us*. In tents and firelight, in flesh and blood, and one day, face to face. Sukkot proclaims this one thunderous reality: God is with you.

## A Thinly Veiled Life

A tent is a thin wall against a big world. You hear the night breeze, the crickets, the soft murmur of a nearby stream. There's no drywall—just a sheet made for a kite—and somehow the closeness inside feels sweeter than a house. Sukkot calls us into that thin place: fewer layers, more presence; less insulation, more intimacy. God meets us in the tent.

**Question:** Where do you feel most exposed or in need of God's nearness right now?

### 1. God dwelt with Israel in tents

> "You shall dwell in booths for seven days… that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt." (Leviticus 23:42–43)

**Teaching Point:** Sukkot trains our souls to remember: God shepherds His people through wilderness by dwelling with them in their weakness and vulnerability, not apart from it. He wants to walk with you through your weakness.

**Question:** What does it look like to walk with God in our weakness?

### 2. God tabernacled among us in Jesus

> "And the Word became flesh and dwelt (tabernacled) among us…" (John 1:14)

Many have noted John's deliberate word choice, which echoes the presence that "dwelt" among Israel. Some scholars suggest the timing of Luke 1 (Zechariah's division, Elizabeth's conception) places Yeshua's birth during Sukkot. Jerusalem and nearby Bethlehem swelled with pilgrims because returning to Jersualem for this Feast was mandatory (Deut. 16:16). "No room" in the guest space makes sense, and the newborn laid in a manger—which may have been one of the many sukkots made during that week. It doesn't prove He was born duriong this time, but it beautifully fits John's claim: the Son came, not to a palace, but to dwell with us. Immanuel.

> "They shall call His name Immanuel," which is translated, "God with us." (Matthew 1:23)

**Teaching Point:** Jesus is God-with-us. He wants to live in the ordinary and even tragic moments of our life.

**Question:** How does truly believing Jesus has "pitched His tent" beside you change the way you endure hardship?

### 3. God dwells in us now—and will dwell with us forever

> "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them…" (Revelation 21:3)

> "…everyone… shall go up… to keep the Feast of Tabernacles." (Zechariah 14:16)

**Teaching Point:** Sukkot holds time together—past (He led us), present (He fills us), future (He will be with us forever).

**Question:** What can we do to honor this Feast? What practices can you build into your life to remember Immanuel?

## Closing

God is with you now. One day He will dwell with us forever. Until that eternal day, we practice His presence with joy.

### Reflective Questions

- Will you welcome Him into your "tent" today? An honest life, thinly veiled, not shrouded in secrecy.
- What comfort can I "leave behind" to make room for His presence?
