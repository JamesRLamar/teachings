- New Year Resolutions have over a 90% failure rate
    
- Don't resolve to do something tomorrow, because you can't.
    
- Resolve to do something today, because it's the only day you can.
    

**Joshua 24**

14 And now, fear Yahweh, serve Him in perfection and in truth, and put away the mighty ones which your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh!

15 And if it seems evil in your eyes to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves this day whom you are going to serve, whether the mighty ones which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the mighty ones of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But I and my house, we serve Yahweh.

**1 Kings 18**

20 So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel.

21 And Elijah came to all the people, and said, “How long will you falter between two opinions? If Yahweh is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.” But the people answered him not a word.

Pesach - to be overstretched to the pointed of being wrenched or dislocated; to make room for another; to fall limp

**Exodus 12:13**

Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.

**1 Kings 18**

22-24 Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone am left a prophet of Yahweh; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men. Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it. Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of Yahweh; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.” So all the people answered and said, “It is well spoken.”

26 So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, “O Baal, hear us!” But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made.

27-28 And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, “Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.” So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.

29 And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention.

30 Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of Yahweh that was broken down.

31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Yahweh had come, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”

32 Then with the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.

33 And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, “Fill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.”

34-35 Then he said, “Do it a second time,” and they did it a second time; and he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time. So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.

36 And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, “Yahweh God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word.

37 Hear me, O Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know that You are Yahweh God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You again.”

38 Then the fire of Yahweh fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.

39 Now when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, “Yahweh, He is God! Yahweh, He is God!”

**Does our sacrifice to Yahweh say, "Here is the least I could offer. I hope it's enough to get me into heaven, or keep you from getting angry"?**

**Instead of over-thinking, over-analyzing, over-committing, over whatever, let's start over-delivering our obedience to God and give Him the excess.**

- Instead of over-worrying, start over-trusting
    
- Instead of over-working, start over-worshipping
    
- Instead of over-doing, start over-being in the moment
    
- Instead of over-scrutinizing other people, start over-loving them
    
- Instead of over-committing, start over-delivering
    

**James 1:17**

Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.
