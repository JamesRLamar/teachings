# The Two Marks

**Ezekiel 9:4-7**
and the Lord said to him, "Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it." To the others He said in my hearing, "Go after him through the city and kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity. Utterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were before the temple.

**Revelation 14:9-11**
Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name."

**Revelation 18:4-5**
And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues. For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities."

**Revelation 18:8**
Therefore her plagues will come in one day—death and mourning and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judges her.

**Revelation 7:2-3**
Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, saying, "Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."

**Revelation‬ ‭12‬:‭17**  
And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

**‭‭Revelation‬ ‭14‬:‭12**
Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

# Godly vs. Worldly Sorrow

**2 Corinthians 7:10**
For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.

**2 Corinthians 7:9-11**
Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing. For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death. For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vindication!

**Proverbs 28:13**
He who covers his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.

- Worldly sorrow drives us far from God

- Godly sorrow produces transformation
- Worldly sorrow produces stagnation

- Godly sorrow seeks grace
- Worldly sorrow seeks escape.
