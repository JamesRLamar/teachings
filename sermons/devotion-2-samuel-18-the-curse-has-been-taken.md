title: Devotion 2 Samuel 18 The Curse has been taken
---


**Today’s chapter picks up when King David’s son Absalom betrayed him and was seeking to kill David and his men. Absalom was a very selfish man, very different from his father. Absalom manipulated nearly all of Israel to fight against David.**

**II Samuel 18:6-9**

So the people went out into the field of battle against Israel. And the battle was in the woods of Ephraim. The people of Israel were overthrown there before the servants of David, and a great slaughter of twenty thousand took place there that day. For the battle there was scattered over the face of the whole countryside, and the woods devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

Then Absalom met the servants of David. Absalom rode on a mule. The mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree, and his head caught in the terebinth; so he was left hanging between heaven and earth. And the mule which was under him went on.

**Deuteronomy 21:22–23 teaches that there was a divine curse placed on a person who as killed by hanging on a tree: **

“And if a man has committed a crime punishable by death and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall bury him the same day, for a hanged man is cursed by God. You shall not defile your land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance” (ESV)

**II Samuel 18:14-15**

Then Joab said, “I cannot linger with you.” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absalom’s heart, while he was still alive in the midst of the terebinth tree. And ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded Absalom, and struck and killed him.

What do you think about how Absalom died?

**II Samuel 18:18**

Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up a pillar for himself, which is in the King’s Valley. For he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” He called the pillar after his own name. And to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument.

Have you ever seen monuments or statues made in honor of great people?

Why do people make monuments of great people?

Why did Absalom make a monument to himself?

**II Samuel 18:33**

Then the king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said thus: “O my son Absalom—my son, my son Absalom—if only I had died in your place! O Absalom my son, my son!”

**If Absalom was such a bad person, why was David so said when he died?**

**This story parallels our relationship with God. We are like Absalom. We have all sinned and at one time in our life acted disrespectfully and even hatefully towards God even though he is nothing but a good father like David. We deserve the same kind of curse that Absalom did because of our rebellion. Yet, just like David, God is such a loving father. He wishes that he could die in our place instead of us. In fact, that’s exactly what he did.**

**Jesus was also referred to as the Son of David and yet he is also the Father. Jesus took our curse by being killed on a tree.**

**
**
**Galatians 3:13**

Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree’

**Acts 5:30**
The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree

**What do you think about God saving you from the curse by taking the curse on himself?**

**What kind of response should we have because of that kind of love?**
