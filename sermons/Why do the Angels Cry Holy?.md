1. Desperation begets total surrender.
2. Without desperation, surrender is not possible.
3. Why do the angels cry holy?

**Desperation** is a position of the heart that embraces surrender becuase the soul has exhausted all other paths and sees no alternative.

"Desperate" originates from the Latin word "desperatus," which means "to lose hope."

"Hope" means to expect good.

Therefore, one desperate for God does not expect good for anything except God. One who is desperate sees God as the only good.

**Revelation 4:8**  
The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: 'Holy, holy, holy, is *Yahweh* God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!'

Why do the Angels Cry Holy? 

**Isaiah 6**  
1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw *Yahweh* sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. 

2 Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 

3 And one cried to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is *Yahweh* of hosts; The whole earth is full of His glory!"

5 So I said: "Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, *Yahweh* of hosts."

6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth with it, and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, And your sin *covered*."

8 And I heard the voice of *Yahweh*, saying: "Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?" Then I said, "Here am I! Send me."

**Psalm 42:1-2**  
As the deer pants for the water brooks, So pants my soul for You, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?
    
**Philippians 3:8**  
Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as *garbage*, that I may gain Christ.


- How can you cultivate a heart that is desperate for God, acknowledging Him as your only source of hope?

- How does recognizing the majesty of God lead you to deeper worship and surrender in your daily life?
