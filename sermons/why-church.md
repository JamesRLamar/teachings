# Why Church?

## Introduction: Begin with the End in Mind

- **Discussion**: 
    - What does it mean to truly stand in the day of judgment?
    - **Two Pillars of Salvation**: 
        - [Revelation 12:17](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/REV.12.17): "The dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."
        - [Jeremiah 31:33](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/JER.31.33): "But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
        - [Hebrews 10:16](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/HEB.10.16): "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them."
    - Why is Church important to help prepare people for Judgment?
    - How does the Church help prepare people?
    - **Four Pillars of the Church**:
        - [Acts 2:42](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/ACT.2.42): "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers."
- **Question**: What if the fire of persecution began to heat up right now? How would the modern church continue to function? 
- **Question**: What will you do when that day comes? Will you wait until then to start doing whatever that is, or is it important to start now?

## 1. Why Gather? (Pillar: Loving Fellowship)

- **Discussion**:
    - What’s the big difference between gathering at a mega-church and a home-based church?
    - **Size**: Physics changes when things become smaller. Consider the grasshopper. 
    - **Expectation**: how does a mega church measure success? Discipleship should not be measured by how many people are in a place, but by what place the people are in. 
    - **Intimacy**: what example did Jesus lead with when it came to focused discipleship? How large was His group?
    - **Challenge**: How has the modern Church adapted itself to fit in with cultural trends?
- **Introspective Thought**: A Church that conforms to the world can never transform the world.
- **Introspective Thought**: - "Don’t be afraid to develop gatherings that will be dull if God doesn’t move.” -- Francis Chan.
- **Hebrews 10:25** TS2009: 
	- "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging, and so much more as you see the Day coming near."

## 2. Why Teach? (Pillar: Apostles Teaching)

- **Discussion**: 
    - What is the danger of false doctrine and the importance of sound teaching?
    - The word disciple means "taught one", but what should that look like in our day to day lives
- **Introspective Thought**: A garden that grows both weeds and flowers will not flourish; sound doctrine prunes the weeds and nourishes the fruitful.
- **Acts 17:11** NKJV: 
  These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.
- **Question**: Do you share the qualities of a Berean?
- **Revelation 18:4**:
  And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come **out** **of** **her**, **my** **people**, lest you share in **her** sins, and lest you receive **of** **her** plagues."
- **Thought**: Revelation 18 is not just a call to repentance, it's an invitation to something. What do you think that something more is?

## 3. Why Pray and Worship? (Pillar: Prayer and Worship)

- **Discussion**: 
    - Leonard Ravenhill has said, "No man is greater than his prayer life." What do you think this means?
- **Psalm 51:17** NKJV: 
  The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
- **Philippians 4:6-7** NKJV:
  Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
- **Question**: What do you think Paul means by supplication?
- **Question**: If the heart is an altar; what is the daily sacrifice you are offering?

## 4. Why Give? (Pillar: Radical Generosity)

- **Discussion**: 
	- **Acts 20:33-35** NKJV:
	  I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel. Yes, you yourselves know that these hands have provided for my necessities, and for those who were with me. I have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'
	- How was Yeshua radically generous if He owned nothing?
	- What is the importance of being radically generous in discipleship.
	- **Multiplication and Maturity**: All mature and healthy things multiply. Is anyone excluded from the work of going and making disciples?
	- **Mission**: What was it that first drew you to Jesus? Do you think there are other people in your circles who Him too?
- **Introspective Thought**: The seed that never gets sown never multiplies.
- **2 Corinthians 9:6:7** NKJV:
  He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.
- **Question**: Remember the parable of the talents. Are you sowing into God's kingdom or hiding the seeds God has given you?

## Activity: A Letter from Jesus

**Psalm 19:14**
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be pleasing before You, O Yahweh, my rock and my redeemer.

- **Prompt**: Take time to write down answers to the following questions and write a letter to yourself from Jesus.
    1. If Jesus wrote a letter to you, what words would he add to encourage you?
    2. What things would He ask of you that would be challenging?
    3. What would be His closing prayer for you?
