title: Lessons in Perseverance
---



This past week, I had the chance to teach Jiu Jitsu for the first time in a while. I usually lead the advanced class, but this time I filled in for the fundamentals class. Since it was impromptu, I hadn’t prepared a lesson. So I told the students they could ask any question—offense, defense, strategy, whatever they wanted.

One student raised his hand. Tony is about my age and has only been training for a year, but he already has one of the most mature mindsets I’ve seen in a beginner. Most white belts, when given open floor like this, ask about flashy submissions—the “unstoppable” move that works on everyone. I get it. Submitting your opponent is the goal, and people want shortcuts.

But Tony asked a different kind of question. He said, “How do I escape bad positions… and stay out?” That was a great question. We have a saying in Jiu Jitsu: **“Position before submission.”** It usually takes people years before that truth moves from theory into practice. But it’s a foundational concept, and this was a fundamentals class—so we leaned into it for the next hour.

There’s no single magic move to escape every bad position, much less stay out of them. I taught a core concept instead—something adaptable, something deeper than a technique. The reality is, sometimes we get into bad positions because our opponent is more skilled, or just heavier. And sometimes, we put ourselves there—through our own mistakes. Either way, we suffer. We call it “pressure,” but what we really mean is suffocating, crushing, bruising pain—the kind that awakens claustrophobia in even the toughest person.

In those moments, you're stuck—flat, lungs pinned shut, unable to breathe. Submitting would be a relief. But Jiu Jitsu demands you endure. You stay in the fire. You fight to survive.

I've seen grown men cry under that kind of pressure. Literally.

And yet, in the culture of this art, **submitting to pressure is the most shameful loss.** Not being choked or joint-locked—but being smothered, held down, and helpless. It’s a trial of both body and soul.

The crucible of pressure teaches you something: how to stay calm, how to think, how to move with wisdom instead of panic. You’ll endure that crucible many, many times before you ever learn how to escape and stay "escaped."

But this applies to more than just Jiu Jitsu.
This is life.  

Spiritually, the same principle applies: it is often in our most **difficult and crushing moments**—our “bad positions”—that God does the deepest work in us.

Just like in Jiu Jitsu, there are times in life where:
- We're under external pressure (tough family life, sickness, loneliness, depression).
- Or we've put ourselves in bad positions (sin, poor choices, pride).

And in both cases, the solution isn’t always a miraculous escape or a quick fix. Instead, God teaches us principles—**spiritual disciplines**, like prayer, humility, patience, faithfulness—that can be applied in all kinds of situations. 

>Not flashy, but fundamental.

**1 Corinthians 10:13**
No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.

**Romans 5:3–4**
And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces **perseverance**; and perseverance, **character**; and character, hope.

**Character** means the proof of testing. It comes not from going through hard things, but enduring hard things.

**Perseverance** means to remain. 

In practice it means we don't run from discomfort, we don't hide, we don't distract ourselves. It means to remain in Him while we remain in the fire. There is no point remaining in the fire if you don't remain with Him. If you're in the fire without Him, you're just in the fire. But if you're with Him, you're in the firs of His Spirit.

In Jiu Jitsu, we learn to endure the pressure—sometimes to survive, sometimes to escape, but always to grow. But spiritually, the pressure of sin is different. It’s not just painful—it’s inescapable. Our guilt, our shame, our darkest deeds—they don’t just pin us, they condemn us. And no amount of training or self-effort can lift that weight. But there’s One who took the full weight upon Himself—not because He had to, but because we couldn’t bear it ourselves.

**Isaiah 53:5** (paraphrase)
But He was pierced for our sins,
He was crushed for our darkest deeds;
He was punished for our peace,
And by His bruises we are healed.

**Isaiah 53:6-7**
All we like sheep have gone astray;
We have turned, every one, to his own way;
And the Lord has laid upon Himself the sin of us all.
He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
Yet He opened not His mouth;
He was led as a lamb to the slaughter,
And as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
So He opened not His mouth.

>Jesus didn't submit to sin, He didn't surrender to pain. He died so that we could live.

**1 John 1:9**
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
