**Daniel 6:10**

The king agreed and even though Daniel heard about the new law, he still went to his room three times a day to pray to God alone. He had done this every day since he was a young man.

**Luke 5:15-16**

However, the report went around concerning Him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities. So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.

**Psalms‬ ‭1**
**1** Blessed is the man
Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,
Nor stands in the path of sinners,
Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;

**2** But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
And in His law he meditates day and night.

**3** He shall be like a tree
Planted by the rivers of water,
That brings forth its fruit in its season,
Whose leaf also shall not wither;
And whatever he does shall prosper.

**Psalms‬ ‭63:1**
**1** Oh God, You are my God; Early will I seek You; My soul thirsts for You.

**6** I remember you while lying on my bed. I think about you in the middle of the night.

**7 **That is because you are the one who helps me. It makes me happy to be under your protection!

**8 **I stay close to you, and you hold me with your powerful arm.

This Psalm was written when David was in the wilderness running for his life. This was not a convenient time in his life yet he kept God first by seeking Him first.

Matthew 6:33, "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."

**Jeremiah 29**

**11** For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.

**12** Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.

**13** And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.
