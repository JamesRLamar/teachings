# What Comes First?

> "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you." Matthew 6:33

## The Two Lists

**Let's make two lists:**

First — what are the things that typically "come before" in your day? What gets in the way of putting God first?
*(Phone, work, kids, distractions, busyness, entertainment...)*

Second — what does doing God's will actually look like? What would a day look like if you put Him first?
*(Prayer, Scripture, presence with family, patience, generosity, obedience in the small things...)*

---

Now look at your first list again.

If anything comes *before* God, what does Scripture call that? Idolatry.

“You shall have no other gods before Me...you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments." Exodus 20:3-6

And that second list, the things we are commanded to do but don't? What is that? Disobedience. Defiance.

> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."  Matthew 7:21

This is more serious than we like to admit.

Too many Christians have no vision for their life. They have goals, but they don't renew their minds with those goals. Many want to know God, to love Him well, to love others well, to put first things first. But they are so easily distracted by the troubles of today that they make no provision for what matters most tomorrow. Many of us want a beautiful harvest, but we don't sow the right seeds each day. We pray for God's will to be done in our lives, yet make no room in our calendars for His presence.

**What if I told you that 10 minutes a day could change your life forever?**

## We Need to Put God First

>"You shall have no other gods before Me." Exodus 20:3

Priority means *what comes before.* What comes first in your day reveals what is first in your life.

But before God commands anything, He expresses relationship. 

> "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." Exodus 20:2

What comes first is always being with Him, not doing anything. Doing follows being.

> "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you." Matthew 6:33

**What does it look like to put God first in your day?**

It takes 5 minutes to pray for every person you know well. It takes 5 minutes to read a meaningful meditation carefully. The hard part is not the doing, it's just getting started.

**Why is it so hard to put God first?**

Steven Pressfield, author of the War of Art, said: "There's a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don't, and the secret is this. It's not the writing part that's hard,. What's hard is sitting down to write. Whats keeps us from sitting down is Resistance."

What Steven calls Resistance, God calls idolatry. And that's because what gets our attention is what we become.

Psychologists summarize it this way: *"What you attend to repeatedly becomes who you are."*

God knew it first.

> "As he thinks in his heart, so is he." Proverbs 23:7

> "And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God." Romans 12:2

## We Need Vision

> "Where there is no vision, the people perish…" Proverbs 29:18a

> "Write the vision and make it plain on tablets, that he may run who reads it." Habakkuk 2:2

Modern cognitive research confirms what Scripture has always said:

- Daily review of goals strengthens neural pathways related to self-control
- Increases congruence between values and behavior
- Reduces decision fatigue by pre-deciding priorities

Research confirms this: written goals increase follow-through by as much as 30–40% in some domains. Science backs what God has always expected.

Are you reaping all the good and God things you want for your life?

## We Need to Sow Today

What you reap today tells you what you sowed yesterday. 

> "Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap." Galatians 6:7

"How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives." — Annie Dillard

We must take this seriously. Putting God and His kingdom first is not optional for "real" Christians.

> "Cling to discipline. Do not relax your grip on it. Keep it, for it is your very life." Proverbs 4:13, GW

## Closing

The distractions that come before Him are idols.  
The will of God left undone is defiance.
But putting God first in everything great and small is eternal life, now and forever.

- What currently gets the "first" of your day?
- What one small change could you make tomorrow morning to put God first?
- Have you written down a vision for your life — or are you drifting toward wherever the current takes you?

## Practical Application: A Daily Vision

Create vision statements with personal accountability questions and review them every day. This keeps what's first top of mind — in the small and in the big.

**Relationships:**  
- Vision: **To walk closely with my God.**  
- Questions: Have I spent quality time with Him today? Have I slowed down enough to hear His voice?  

- Vision: **To love my wife like Jesus loves the Church. To raise up my daughters to be prophetesses.**  
- Questions: Have I spent quality time with my family today? Have I communicated my appreciation to them? Have I guarded my heart and my reputation?  

- Vision: **To make devoted disciples ready for Judgment Day.**  
- Questions: Have I prayed for each person in my circles today? Have I cast vision and spent time equipping them this week?

**Physical and Mental Health:**  
- Vision: **To be strong and healthy. To be whole and happy.**  
- Questions: Is this food choice good for my brain and body? Did I exercise or do active recovery today? Did I deep breathe and meditate when I felt tired?

**Work:**  
- Vision: **To find joy in my work and minimize its impact on what matters most. To be light in the darkness.**  
- Questions: Have I reserved my best energy for my health or relationships? Have I let my actions and attitude shine in such a way that others glorify God?

**Financial Health:**  
- Vision: **To be a faithful and generous steward.**  
- Questions: Is this purchase within my budget?

### Other Scriptures

>“Whoever is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much." Luke 16:10

> "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever." 1 John 2:15-17
