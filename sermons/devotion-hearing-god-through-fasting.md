What is a spirit? It is a “smind” or soul/mind
What is a demon? It is a foul mind

**Ephesians 6:12 NKJV**

For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

**Daniel 9 and 10**

- There are different kinds of fasting
- There are different reasons for fasting
- Demons have hierarchy
- Demons have different power
- Demons have geographic assignments
- Demons want to prevent prophecy
- Angels are not all-powerful
- God heard Daniel from the moment he fasted and prayed
- Fasting unlocked the messenger and empowered the angel to prevail when Michael came to his aid
- Fasting unlocked understanding of the message
- Fasting allowed Daniel to see the angel when others couldn't

**Acts 19:11-17 NKJV**

**11** Now God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul, so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them. Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “We exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.” Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?”

**16** Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. This became known both to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

- Demons respond to the name of Christ and others who follow him
- Demons are not to be trifled with

**Mark 9:29**

- Some demons are stubborn or more powerful
- Some demons cannot be cast out except by prayer AND fasting
- Demons and sickness or correlated

**Matthew 17:21**

- If fasting really is so powerful against demons, why wouldn’t demons try to corrupt God’s word by removing this teaching?

**Romans 14**

- Fasting was expected to be a weekly occurrence
