# Walking in the Spirit: Freedom from Religious Requirements

## Context for Galatians

Paul wrote this letter after hearing that the church in Galatia had started following the teaching of people called Judaizers (Galatians 2:14, Acts 15:1). Judaizers were Christians who taught that you had to keep the law of Moses and be circumcised to be saved. This is a very important point to understand when reading any of Paul's letters as the entire second half of his missionary life was dedicated to going back to all the churches he planted to teach against Judaizers. The other point we need to extract is the difference between the two laws. An obvious distinction is not always made in Scripture when the context is the law of Moses or the Law of God, so we need to carefully discern the context.

## Galatians 5: Freedom and Walking in the Spirit

**1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Messiah has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.**

The yolk of slavery here represents the religious requirements of the law of Moses. "Yolk" is synonymous with the religious requirements of the law of Moses, like circumcision.

**2 Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Messiah will profit you nothing. And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law.**

Paul is saying that trusting in the requirements of the law for righteousness is a fool's errand, it profits nothing.

**4 You have become estranged from Messiah, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.**

Paul explains that those who started following the Messiah, and later trust in religious requirements for righteousness, have "fallen from grace".

**What does it mean to trust in religious requirements for righteousness?**

The main premise is that we try to keep the law, both the laws, from the outside in. It's not just about those who believe keeping the law of Moses is necessary for salvation, like circumcision.

Trusting in religious requirements for righteousness also extends to those who outwardly are righteous, but inwardly are corrupt. The point of Yeshua's message in Matthew 5 was to say that the Law of God must be kept from the inside out. Adultery and murder in the heart are adultery and murder. Refraining from outward adultery or murder was never the real end.

**5 For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Messiah Yeshua neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.**

Here is yet another summary, we wait for righteousness through trust in the sacrifice of Yeshua. Trust, which manifests itself through love is fulfilling the Commandments.

**7 You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you. A little leaven leavens the whole lump. I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.**

Paul declares that judgment awaits those who teach others to trust in religious activity as evidence of spiritual vitality.

**11 And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased. I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!**

The emphasis here is that if righteousness could be achieved by simply trying harder and keeping all the religious requirements of the law then the Messiah died for nothing!

**13 For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."**

We have freedom from religious requirements, but that freedom does not extend to fueling worldly desires of the flesh. There are boundaries and those boundaries are the Law of God summed up in "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." We are still expected to "serve one another" through love.

**16 I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.**

This is the focus of this entire letter. If we walk in the Spirit, all other things will care for themselves. Notice the focus is not "try harder" at bearing the fruit of the Spirit, as is commonly taught. Instead, the emphasis is to become one intimately with the mind and heart of God, then the fruit becomes a byproduct of knowing Him.

**But why does Paul start talking about "the lust of the flesh" when the topic concerns Judaizers?**

Paul is saying that wanting to made be self-righteous is a fleshly desire. It is an anti-messiah (antichrist) desire to remove power from the sacrifice of Yeshua. To say His sacrifice was not enough or that His Spirit is not enough to transform is to diminish the Messiah. That is anti-messiah. So the "lust of the flesh" in this context is synonymous with those who desire righteousness apart of Yeshua.

**17 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.**

Here again, you see Paul referring to the lust of the flesh as synonymous with trying to be righteous via the religious requirements of the law. There is a common misinterpretation of this verse, just like several of Paul's letters. Many read the part of this verse that says, "so that you do not do the things that you wish", and think it means that we are slaves to our sinful nature. The same suppose that we are incapable of obedience to God and His Commandments. However, reading on, we see that if we truly are led by the Spirit, we are "not under the law".

Paul uses the word "under" to refer to enslavement. He says we are NOT slaves to religious requirements and in other verses he makes it clear we are also not slaves to the sinful or fleshly nature. Romans 6:6 says, "Because of this we are no longer slaves to sin." Just a few verses later, Paul says what we are slaves to. Romans 6:18, "And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness."

In the next few verses, Paul describes the fruit of those who are slaves to the flesh (righteousness via the religious requirements of the law).

**19 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.**

The consequence of fleshly living is serious, just as Paul has already said that to trust in religious requirements is to fall from grace. This is a salvation issue. Next, Paul contrasts the fruit of the flesh with the fruit of the Spirit.

**22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. And those who are the Messiah's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.**

Remember that the "law" and the "flesh" are synonymous. In the latter part of the verse, "Against such there is no law", Paul is saying there is no fleshly equivalent to the fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit is entirely contrary to the fruit of the flesh.

Regarding the fruit of the Spirit, remember that this list is descriptive, not prescriptive. Paul is not saying we need to "try harder" to bear this fruit. He says the fruit is evidence of God's Spirit living and reigning within us.

**25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.**

Do not be content to trust in a bygone experience. Do not "maintain" by continuing religious activity as a disguise for spiritual transformation. If you say the Spirit lives within you, you should keep in step with the Spirit.

Bearing the fruit of the Spirit does not come through effort or insistence. Imagine yelling at a tree, "Grow up tree! Get control of yourself! Bear fruit tree!". It is not in demanding performance that the tree grows, but in tending to the things which bring it life that the tree will do what it is meant to do.

The fruit are not meant to fuel shame. They are a test that allows us to be honest with ourselves.

**Is there enough evidence to convict you of walking in the Spirit?**

**So what does evidence look like for someone who walks in the Spirit?**

**What is *not* evidence:**

- The lack of lying is not synonymous with being honest with oneself
- Being nice or polite is not the same as being kind or good
- Attendance in Church or reading Bible is not evidence that you walk with God (although these things are good of course)
- Being a good person is not evidence that your soul has been transformed by the Spirit of God
- The absence of stealing is not the absence of coveting
- The absence of murder is not the presence of love
