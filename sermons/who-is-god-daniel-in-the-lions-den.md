**Daniel 6**

Daniel 6 begins with the new reign of Kind Darius. The king setup 120 leaders over all the kingdom of Babylon and he made three men responsible for those 120. One of those leader of leaders was Daniel.

**3 **Then this Daniel set himself apart from all the other leaders, because an awesome spirit *was* in him; and the king even thought about making him ruler over the whole realm.

**4 **So the other leaders became jealous and looked for a way to get Daniel in trouble. But they couldn’t  find anything wrong with him or his behavior. Daniel was faithful as a servant and faithful to God.

 **5 **The jealous men realized the only way to trap Daniel was to make a law that would force him to break the Law of God.

6 So the jealous leaders went to King Darius and tricked him into making a new law for just 30 days that if any prays for help to any god or any man besides the king that they should be thrown into a den of hungry lions.

**10 **The king agreed and even though Daniel heard about the new law, he still went to his room three times a day to pray to God alone. He had done this every day since he was a young man.

**13** When the jealous leaders saw Daniel praying they went and told on him to the king.

**14 **And when the king heard what happened he was very upset with himself and sought a way to save Daniel, but he could not.

**16 **So the king gave the command, and they brought Daniel and cast *him* into the den of lions. *But* the king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve always, He will save you.” Then a stone was brought to cover the den, and the king sealed it with his own ring.

**19 **Early the next morning, the king arose and went to the den, crying out to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve always, been able to save you from the lions?”

**21 **Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! My God has saved me because I have done no wrong.”

Afterwards the king was so mad with those who tried to kill Daniel that he threw them into the lion’s den and they were immediately eaten.

**25 **Then King Darius wrote a letter to the whole world:

**26 **I proclaim that in every part of my kingdom all *people must* respect and fear the God of Daniel.

For He *is* the living God,
And lives forever;
His kingdom *is the one* which shall not be destroyed,
And His rule *shall endure* for all time.

**27 **He saves and rescues,
And He does miracles and wonders
In heaven and on earth,
He is the one who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.

**28 **So Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus.

**Why was Daniel thrown into the lion’s den?**
**What happened to Daniel after he was thrown into the den?**

**What does this story teach us about who God is? Remember the last verses about what King Darius learned about God. **
