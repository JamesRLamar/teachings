title: Self Control

**Galatians 5:22-23**

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control...

**Self-control: Temperance**

Webster's Dictionary: Moderation in action, thought, or feeling: RESTRAINT. Habitual moderation in the indulgence of the appetites or passions.

**Proverbs 29:18**
Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;
But happy is he who keeps the law.

When we have vision, we have control.

When we don’t have vision, we cast off restraint or self-control.

**What kind of vision do we need?**

Perspective, seeing ourselves the way God sees us empowers us to be focused on what matters most.

We must be healthy to grow.

**When we are healthy:**

- We are focused
- We are self-controlled
- We are energized
- We grow

The only unhealthy things that grow are cancers and weeds.

**When we are unhealthy:**

- We cannot focus. It's not that we don't want to focus, it's that we simply can't. Self-control requires energy and effort.
- We do only the bare minimum to get by
- We are more put off by the discomfort needed for change than we are in the suffering of our present brokenness

We must choose to control the self, or selfish ambitions will control us.

**When the "Self" controls us:**

- We allow selfish ambition to dictate our life
- We allow selfish ambition to consume our focus
- We lust after distraction and entertainment
- We become obsessed with what is external and neglect what is internal

**‭Proverbs 25‬:‭28‬ ‭**
A man who has no control over his spirit Is like a broken-down city without a wall.

What does lack of self-control look like:
Finances?
Temper?
Physical health?
Mental health?
Spiritual health?

I find that the things we neglect the most are the same things we like to think about the least. Why is that dangerous? What can we do about that?
