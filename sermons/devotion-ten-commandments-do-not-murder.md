Test the children to quote all Ten Commandments. Have a craft ready for afterwards to fulfill the Shema by writing the Ten Words on a banner to be hung on the door of their room. A mezuzah.

Exodus 20:13
You do not murder

[Matthew 5:21-22](https://my.bible.com/bible/406/MAT.5.21-22)

You have heard that it was said to our people long ago, ‘You must not murder anyone. Any person who commits murder will be judged.’ But I tell you, don’t be angry with anyone. If you are angry with others, you will be judged. And if you insult someone, you will be judged by the high court. And if you call someone a fool, you will be in danger of the fire of hell.

**Hatred speaks of possession. Remember last week we talked about the root of coveting or greed is around possession or praise. **

**When we are possessive, we grow angry and bitter because of what someone has taken from us or threatens to take from us. **

**When we are possessive, w****e hate when someone is more talented than us, because they steal our glory. **

**When we are possessive, w****e hate when someone sees our imperfection, because they threaten to expose us. **

**When we are possessive and selfish, w****e hate when someone hurts us because they threaten our comfort.**

**Selfishness and possessiveness are the root of anger and hatred. **

Exodus 18:21 NKJV

Moreover you shall select from all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

[Matthew 5:43-48 ERV](https://my.bible.com/bible/406/MAT.5.43-48)

You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies. Pray for those who treat you badly. If you do this, you will be children who are truly like your Father in heaven. He lets the sun rise for all people, whether they are good or bad. He sends rain to those who do right and to those who do wrong. If you love only those who love you, why should you get a reward for that? Even the tax collectors do that. And if you are nice only to your friends, you are no better than anyone else. Even the people who don’t know God are nice to their friends. What I am saying is that you must be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

**The word “perfect” in Matthew 4:48 means “complete” or without any holes. **

**Do the illustration of drilling holes in a cup of water like wounds or hurt. Dover the cup with a complete cup. This is a symbol of hiding ourselves in God’s perfect love.**

[I John 4:19-21](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/1JN.4.19-21)

We love Him because He first loved us. If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also.

**We forgive, when we stop trying to control and possess the bad things done to us.**

**We love, when we know how loved we are.**

**We love, when we truly know God, because God is love.**

**We hate, when we fear. **
**When we fear being exposed. **
**When we fear being hurt. **
**When we fear letting go of control because we are afraid of being hurt.**

[I John 4:18](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/1JN.4.18)

**There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.**
