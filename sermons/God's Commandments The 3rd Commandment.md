Exodus 20:7 TS2009
You do not bring the Name of Yahweh your Elohim to naught, for Yahweh does not leave the one unpunished who brings His Name to naught.

Bring - "take", upon or bear up or lift up
Naught - "vain", to make empty or worthless
Name - reputation as a mark or memorial

Revelation 14:1 TS2009
And I looked and saw a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father’s Name written upon their foreheads.

Revelation 22:4 TS2009
And they shall see His face, and His Name shall be upon their foreheads.

Revelation 13:16-17
Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name.

Revelation 14:9-11
And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink the wine of God’s wrath..."

The second Commandment describes the qualities of the Mark of God vs the Mark of the Beast. The third Commandment extends this concept to include taking on the name of God in a way that brings Him tremendous dishonor.

Ezekiel 36 TS2009
22 Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus said the Master Yahweh, “I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My set-apart Name’s sake, which you have profaned among the nations wherever you went.

23 And I shall set apart My great Name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. And the nations shall know that I am Yahweh,” declares the Master Yahweh, “when I am set-apart in you before their eyes.

24 And I shall take you from among the nations, and I shall gather you out of all lands, and I shall bring you into your own land.

25 And I shall sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean – from all your filthiness and from all your idols I cleanse you.

26 And I shall give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you. And I shall take the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I shall give you a heart of flesh,

27 and put My Spirit within you. And I shall cause you to walk in My laws and guard My right-rulings and shall do them.

Romans 2
22 You who say, “Do not commit adultery,” do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 

23 You who make your boast in the law, do you dishonor God through breaking the law? 

24 For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” as it is written.


1 Timothy 6:1
Let as many bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed.
