title: Devotion Being Transformed Daily

**Romans 12:2 PARA**

And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may truly know and understand God’s perfect plan for your life.

How many days a week must we eat well in order to transform our bodies? What about exercise?

Could we see any benefit from doing those things once a week? What about once or twice a month? Would we ever even reach our goals?

Why do we treat our soul differently? Why is it always such a distant concern to renew our minds every day? What's winning in our life and possibly replacing what matters most?

**Psalms‬ ‭1:1-3 ‭ERV**

**1 **Great blessings belong to those who don’t listen to evil advice who don’t live like sinners, and who don’t join those who make fun of God.

**2** Instead, they love the Lord’s teachings and think about them day and night.

**3 **So they grow strong, like a tree planted by a stream - a tree that produces fruit when it should and has leaves that never fall. Everything they do is successful.

**Psalms‬ ‭63:1 **‭**NKJV**
**1** O God, You are my God; Early will I seek You; My soul thirsts for You.

**Psalms‬ ‭63:6-8‬ **‭**ERV**

**6** I remember you while lying on my bed. I think about you in the middle of the night.

**7 **That is because you are the one who helps me. It makes me happy to be under your protection!

**8 **I stay close to you, and you hold me with your powerful arm.

Notice in Psalm 63, that this was written when David was in the wilderness running for his life. This was not a convenient time in his life yet he kept God first by seeking Him first.

‭

Let’s take time to look within and truly understand what’s going on in our heart. With no guilt or shame let us just understand why we may be neglecting what matters most. Let us begin a serious commitment of daily seeking God first.
