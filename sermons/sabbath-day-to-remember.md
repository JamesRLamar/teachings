# The Sabbath - A Day to Remember

## Why Should We Remember the Seventh-Day Sabbath?

### The Sabbath was created, blessed, and made holy by God at Creation.

### The Sabbath was kept before Mount Sinai.

"One can only say with certainty that already in the pre-exilic period the Sabbath was kept at the end of every week as a day of rest ordained and sanctified by Yahweh."

Eduard Lohse, ["Σάββατον, Σαββατισμός, Παρασκευή,"](https://ref.ly/logosres/tdnt?ref=GreekStrongs.4521&off=7437&ctx=+strictly+as+later.+~One+can+only+say+wit) ed. Gerhard Kittel, Geoffrey W. Bromiley, and Gerhard Friedrich, Theological Dictionary of the New Testament (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1964–), 4.

**Genesis 26:4-5**  
And I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven; I will give to your descendants all these lands; and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed; because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.

**Exodus 16:4-5**
Then the Lord said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not. And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily."

**Exodus 16:22-30**
And so it was, on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. Then he said to them, "This is what the Lord has said: 'Tomorrow is a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. Bake what you will bake today, and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.' " So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it. Then Moses said, "Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none." Now it happened that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none. And the Lord said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws? See! For the Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day." So the people rested on the seventh day.

**Exodus 31:13**
Speak also to the children of Israel, saying: Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the Yahweh who sanctifies you.

### The Ten Commandments are Eternal

**Exodus 20:8-11**
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

**Hebrews 4:9**
9 So there remains a Sabbath-keeping for the people of Elohim. 

**Hebrews 4:10-11**
10 For the one, having entered into His rest, has himself also rested from his works, as Elohim rested from His own. Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.

## What are the Arguments Against the Seventh-Day Sabbath?

**Romans 14:5** 
One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. 

**Colossians 2:16-17** 
So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.

> What did the Fourth Commandment have to do with food and drink, festivals, or new moons? Nothing. Paul's reference here is to feasts and the "sabbaths" mentioned are the annual sabbaths and sabbath weeks.

**Isaiah 1** 
11 "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?" Says the Lord.
I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed cattle.
I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs or goats.

13 Bring no more futile sacrifices; Incense is an abomination to Me.
The New Moons, the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies—I cannot endure iniquity and the sacred meeting.

14 Your New Moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates;
They are a trouble to Me, I am weary of bearing them.

> If the Sabbath was made for the Jews, why did Yeshua say that it was made for all mankind?

**Mark 2:23–28**
23 Now it happened that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and as they went His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain. And the Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"

25 But He said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him: how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the showbread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?"

27 And He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."

> If Yeshua taught that the Sabbath was abolished, why did his disciples continue to respect the Sabbath after His death?

**John 19:31**
Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day)

**Luke 23:56**
Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.

> We've also established from these two verses that Yeshua was not resurrected on Sunday, so the argument that the early church started gathering on Sunday because of the resurrection is moot.

> If Paul taught that the Sabbath was abolished, especially for Gentile Christians, why didn't he establish that practice?

**Acts 13:14**
But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.

**Acts 17:2**
Then Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

**Acts 18:4**
And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.

> If Paul taught that the Sabbath was abolished and that Sunday was the newly accepted day of worship, why didn't he say that to the Gentiles?

**Acts 13:42–44**
42 So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath. 

43 Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

44 On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.

> If the law of Moses included keeping the Sabbath, why didn't the Apostles say so in their letter to all Gentile Christians?

**Acts 15:1**
And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved." 

**Acts 15:2**
Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.

**Acts 15:19–20**
Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God, but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and from blood.

> How did the Apostles, including Paul, expect the Gentiles to learn about what it meant to "abstain from things polluted by idols and sexual immorality..."?

**Acts 15:21**
For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.

## Why Do Most Christians Still Not Keep the Seventh-Day Sabbath?

**Answer**: Because Christians choose tradition over the Commandments of God

**Matthew 15:3–9**
3 He answered and said to them, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 

4 For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.' But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God"— then he need not honor his father or mother.' Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. 

7 Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:
"These people draw near to Me with their mouth,
And honor Me with their lips,
But their heart is far from Me.
And in vain they worship Me,
Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."

### The Converts Catechism of Catholic Doctrine Third Edition

> "Question: Which is the Sabbath day?
Answer: Saturday is the Sabbath day.
Question: Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday?
Answer. We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church in the Council of Laodicea, transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday."

### The Catholic Cardinal Gibbons, in Faith of Our Fathers, pg. 111

> "You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we (The Roman Catholic Church) never sanctify."
