Ebb and flow

Give yourself grace because God is. He’s ok with your honesty 

Don’t kick yourself or someone else when they are down. 

Stones of remembrance will help to bring you out. 

Read Lamentations 3 and notice the pivot starting in verse 20.

Acknowledge the pain and be honest in your doubts and frustrations.

1. **Lamentations 3:25-26**: "The Lord is good to those who wait for Him, To the soul who seeks Him. It is good that one should hope and wait quietly For the salvation of the Lord."
