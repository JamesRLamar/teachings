**Who has ever built a sandcastle?**
**
**
**Why do people build sandcastles?**
**
**
**What's the problem with building a sandcastle?**

The best part of seeing a sandcastle destroyed every day is knowing you get to build it again, but woe to those who can't find joy in building the sandcastle.

**What can the sandcastle represent?**

- Your work
- Your reputation
- Your social  or digital image
- Your love of self

Sandcastles are neither good nor bad, but the mistake we often make is caring and comparing.

- We care too much about preserving what will perish
- We compare too much about something that is childish to compare

Think about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. God made man and woman. he blessed them and told them to be fruitful and multiply. Then he put them in the Garden to tend it.

Something to pay attention to; it was never about the Garden. It was just a reason to interact with God and each other. Woe to those who think their meaning and worth comes from their toil and not the friendship. Friendship with God is only thing of value that will ever blossom from our toil.

**What things last forever?**
Only we last forever

**What are you filling your jar with?**
Sand or Precious stones

**Malachi 4:1 NASB**

For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze, says the Lord of armies, so that it will leave them neither root nor branches.

**1 Corinthians 3:9-15 NKJV**

9 For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, you are God’s building.

10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it. For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

12 Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each one’s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is.

14 If anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward. If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.

**1 Corinthians 3:15 AMP**

But if any person’s work is burned up [by the test], he will suffer the loss [of his reward]; yet he himself will be saved, but only as [one who has barely escaped] through fire.

**Matthew 6:25-34**

25 Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?

27 Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?

28 So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

30 Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?

31 Therefore do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?" For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.

33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.

34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

**Ecclesiastes 2:24**

“Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God.”

**Colossians‬ ‭3:23-24‬**

And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.
