**Ephesians 2:8-9**

For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, **not of works**, lest anyone should boast.

**Ephesians 2:10**

For we are His **workmanship**, created in Christ Jesus for **good works**, which God before **ordained** that we should **walk** in them.

**Workmanship or Craftsmanship**,  that which has been skillfully made by hand.

**Good works**, righteousness in keeping with guarding the Commandments.

**Ordained**, to prepare beforehand in mind and purpose, to decree.

**Walk**, to regulate one's life or to deport oneself as a votary (devoted follower).

God's perfection is not our perfection. Think about how differently we would have come to earth as Jesus did.

**How would the world have thought to set the stage for the King of Kings to be born on earth?**

**What did God's workmanship look like in Jesus?**

Jesus wasn't interested in building things, He came to build people.

**Meditation 1**
I am His workmanship. God doesn’t make junk. I am enough.

**Meditation 2**
God doesn't want your perfection.

**What does God's workmanship look like in your life?**

**What does God's perfection look like in you?**
