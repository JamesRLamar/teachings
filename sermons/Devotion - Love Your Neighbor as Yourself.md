**Leviticus 19:17-18**

You shall not hate your brother **in your heart**. You shall surely rebuke your neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.  You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but **you shall love your neighbor as yourself**: I am the Lord.

**Zechariah 8:17**

Let none of you **think** evil in your heart against your neighbor; And do not love a false oath. For all these are things that I hate,’ Says the Lord.”

**Matthew 5:43-45**

43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.

**Matthew 5:46-48**

46 For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

**Mark 12:29-32**

Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”

Love Your Neighbor **AS** Yourself

We must learn to show compassion to ourselves.

By truly accepting it’s ok for us to struggle we are able to allow others to struggle as well.

We can accept our struggle and others without accepting defeat.

**Romans 13:9**

For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not bear false witness,” “You shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, are all summed up in this saying, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

The essence of this second greatest commandment is do no harm to others, but do we harm ourselves? If we harm ourselves, how can we love others?

The essence of the 6th commandment to refrain from murder is not to even hate in our hearts, but do we hate ourselves?

The essence of the 9th commandment to refrain from false witness is to be truthful and honest, but are we honest with ourselves?

“Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most.” — Abraham Lincoln.

How many of us steal from ourselves by robbing from tomorrow to pay for today's comforts and conveniences?

What kind of love do we need to start showing ourselves so we can reflect that same love to others?
