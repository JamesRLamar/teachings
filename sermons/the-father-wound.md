title: The Father Wound
---


**What is the Father Wound?**

It is broken thinking regarding ourself or our world as the result of human authority failing to love us and/or protect us.

**How many of you have memories of your father or mother or caretaker acting in these ways:**

- Being indifferent to you?
- Blaming you for failure?
- Showing contempt for you?
- Abandoning you?
- Being angry without reason?

**Symptoms of the Father Wound manifest in two general ways:**
1. Too much control
2. Too little confrontation

**What do these two types of wounds look like?**

**Here are some ways these wounds look similar:**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Controlling Wound** | **Confrontation Wound** |
| Anxiety | Anxiety |
| Insecurity - expressed as over confidence | Insecurity - expressed as imposter syndrome |
| Impatience - expressed as being easily frustrated | Impatience - expressed as having a short temper |
| Isolation - expressed as pushing others away | Isolation - expressed as pulling away from others |

**Here are some ways these wounds diverge:**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Controlling Wound** | **Confrontation Wound** |
| OCD of others behavior | OCD of your environment |
| Manipulative | Defiant |
| Perfectionism | Paralysis |
| Aggressive | Passive-Aggressive |
| Uses others | Pleases others |
| Over confident | Under confident |

Our Father Wounds often get projected onto God. When this happens we struggle to believe that God really loves us. But even if we manage to accept that God loves us, even fewer of us with a Father Wound ever come to believe that God likes us.

**Whats the difference between loving someone and liking someone?**

The word "like", simply means to be pleased or delighted with.

**Do you believe that God likes you? Is He delighted and pleased with you?**

**Matthew 3:17**

And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”

**Matthew 12:18**
Behold! My Servant whom I have chosen,
My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased!
I will put My Spirit upon Him,
And He will declare justice to the Gentiles.

**Matthew 17:5**

While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!”

**Hebrews 11:6**

But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.

Seeking God is all that is required to please God, but our Father Wounds often poison our acceptance that God accepts us.
