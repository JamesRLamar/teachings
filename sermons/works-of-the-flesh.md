# The Works of the Flesh: Identifying What Destroys Us

## The Biblical Foundation of the Flesh vs the Spirit

**Romans 8**
1 There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, **who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.** 

2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. 

3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, 

4 that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us **who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.** 

5 For those who live according to the flesh **set their minds** on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 

**What does it mean to "Set your mind"?**

6 For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. 

**How can you know if you are being spiritually minded?**

7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. 

8 So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

**Galatians 5**
16 I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 

17 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. 

18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

19 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 

20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 

21 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
