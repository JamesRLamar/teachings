title: Outline Don t Walk Alone
---


My greatest aspiration is to be a friend of God and to know him as my Father to walk with Him.

I have sort of a State of the Union address regarding the state of our souls. This week I observed that we have a serious **Relational Deficit.**

I see that we are constantly surrounded, yet desperately alone.

We have a thousand friends on Facebook, but no person who knows the condition of our soul.

We have the information of the entire world at our finger tips yet we are starving for truth that can really change us.

Our bodies are living longer than ever before, but our souls have rarely tasted the divine.

We are a people longing for real connectedness, but we live in a world that wars against the real and the authentic.

I found some research done by the university of Minnesota, compiled from over 148 studies done on the impact of healthy relationships versus those who lack quality relationships. The final conclusion after all this research is that:

**Isolation is fatal**.

I believe that more than any other relationship deficit, we are starving for a relationship with God the Father.

I want to make one impression on you that I hope will permeate your thinking for the next 30 minutes. When it comes to the journey of life, I want to implore you:

**Don’t Walk Alone!**

When it comes to finding God, learning how to walk with Him, it helps to first examine how we find something in this physical world. Before we begin any journey, we must first survey and identify where we are right now. To get to where we are going we must first find out where we are.

So it is with the spirit. Before we can set off on our journey to find God the Father we must survey and identify where our soul is. However, we are superficial. We don’t usually take time to take stock of our soul.

One reason is that it’s easier to live the lie than to recognize and deal with the truth. And it’s easier to be distracted than it is to be accountable.

In our culture, we say things like “How’s it going?” and respond with things like “sup”. In ancient cultures and others still around the world there is a common greeting which puts our superficial greetings to shame. What they say is translated as:

**"****How is your soul doing at this very moment, at this very breath?****”**

So how do we take stock of our soul?

**Our soul consists of two parts, our Thoughts and Intents**.

Hebrews 4:12 (NKJV)

For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

**What thoughts dominate our mind?**

**What emotions fill the landscape of our heart?**

**What motives get the most of our attention?**

Answer these questions and you are well on your way to understanding WHERE you are spiritually, at this very moment, at this very breath.

So back to the analogy, we are trying to find a location. First we must identify where we are. Then, if we are intelligent, we ask for directions. If we are a man….. 😆

No seriously, I am so good with finding my way around that one time, without asking for directions one time, I found my way all the from my house to the end of my driveway. I have an incredibly consistent sense of direction. When I pulling away in the parking lot I intuitively know which direction to go…it’s exact opposite of whatever direction I think it is.

Knowing where we are and being aware of our surroundings is so important.

Like the one time I found this 10 speed bicycle...

Next we need a map and we need to ask directions from someone who knows the way.

Sometimes the best way to find out where you are is to ask someone who knows you.

There are going to be times in our life when we need others to help us find our way.

Especially, if we’ve been doing our own thing for a while and we’ve convinced ourselves we’re all good. We got this. Life is good. God is good. I’m all good. While that might be true on the outside it’s far from true on the inside.

What this means is that we are choosing to live **distracted**.

If you’re always looking for the next best thing. If you’re constantly immersed in this virtual, electronic, fast-paced world. If you move from obsession to obsession. If you can’t ever seem to sit still and be present with your friends and family. Chances are you’re just choosing to live distracted.

We have to get away from that kind of thinking. At some point if we don’t see the Father as the ultimate prize then we simply aren’t going to do what’s necessary to find him. If we think there is something better out there, we will find it. We will never wait long enough to see the promise of God fulfilled.

The story of the Tabernacle

God’s people were known as the Hebrew people or Israel. They were in bondage for 400 years and God miraculously and powerfully set them free. God was leading them through Moses to a land promised to their ancestor Abraham, which today we know as the land of Israel. This was known as the Promised Land.

We read in Exodus 33 of Moses getting to talk with God Dr. Phil style. Like come sit in a chair and let’s have a conversation. The people of Israel were nomadic at this point so they moved around a lot and everyone lived in tents. After the camp would get setup Moses would go outside the camp to a solitary place and put up a tent for God. They called it the tabernacle or the Tent of Meeting.

When Moses would start walking towards the Tent of Meeting the people would notice and watch from the door of their tent. As the pillar of Cloud which was the physical presence of God on earth, settled on Moses in the Tent of Meeting the people would begin to worship. The Bible says that God would speak with Moses face to face like a man talks with his friend. You know thats cool! It and then Moses would go back to camp. I think Moses was legit. I think he had something many of us miss, but then the Word says, Moses went back to camp, but Joshua lingered in the tabernacle.

What’s most important is that after all this God said it’s time to go. Moses was scared. He told God if your Presence isn’t coming with us, don’t send us! How many times do we have that backwards? We say this is what I’m going to do and I hope God is for it, but if not He’ll get over it. Instead we ought to recognize that He is the destination. He is our purpose. HE is our pursuit.

So where can God be found? What does His Presence look like?

**7 Places God can be found:**

**1 Simplicity**

2 Corinthians 11:3 (NKJV)

But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

**2 Stillness**

1 Kings 19:11-12 (NKJV)

Then He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before the Lord.” And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.

**3 Solitude**

Luke 5:16 (NKJV)
So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.

**4 Sobriety**

Ephesians 5:18 (GW)

Don’t get drunk on wine, which leads to wild living. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.

**5-Singing**

Ephesians 5:19 (GW)

by reciting psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs for your own good. Sing and make music to the Lord with your hearts.

**6 Sincerity**

John 4:23-24 (NKJV)

But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.

**7 Sabbath**

Exodus 20:8-11 (NKJV)

Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work.

What obstacles are there between you and God?

Maybe you simply lack someone to help show you the way. Church, that’s on us.

What if we already know the truth?

What if we already know all these things, but in our soul we are still far from God. It may be that we are suffering from a terrible spiritual disease. The disease of stubborn indifference.

**Signs of Stubborn Indifference:**

**Untroubled by our sin.**
**Unbending in our will.**
**Unholy in our desires.**
**Uninspired by His Spirit.**
**Unimpressed by His presence.**
**Unmoved by His grace.**

Friends it’s time we take time to take stock.

Are you like the people of Israel, content to watch someone else meet with God while you stand far off? Do you let the pastor or the priest do the work for you? Or are you willing to wait on God? Are you willing to give up everything to call God your friend?

Or maybe at one point in your life you did walk with God, but maybe you have been drawn away by other things you “have” to do? Have other things become more important than lingering in God’s Presence? Are you blazing your own trail without any real concern if God is with you? Or are you learning to linger? Are forsaking all the idols of this world to posses the most beautiful treasure this life has to offer?

I’ve asked a lot of soul searching questions today, but I want to ask one more very important question.

Is Jesus your Lord?

I didn’t ask if you believe in God, or if you think Jesus was a great man or a great teacher. I asked if He is your Lord? As in king. Do you go where he tells you to go? Do you do what he tells you to do? Do you worship him and him alone?

Romans 10:9 (NKJV)

If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

It is not enough that you simply believe there is a God.

Coming to a church service doesn’t make you a Christian any more than eating at McDonald’s makes you a hamburger.

James said, "You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble!”

We must publicly confess that Jesus is Lord.

Matthew 10:32-33 (NKJV)

Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven.

If you are proud that Jesus Christ is not just A king, but YOUR King then please stand with me right now and repeat this declaration after me. “Jesus Christ, the son of God, you are the King of kings. You are the Lord of lords. You are my Lord. Forever. Amen!”

I’d like our elders and prayer partners to come down right now. If you just started your journey today and for the first time declared Jesus Christ as your Lord, I want to meet someone down here so we can walk with you. Nothing intimidating at all. We just want to set you off in the right direction and give some very important tools.

Connection Card.

Trey and Alli.

Others may want to come up as we dismiss for prayer, but let me pray a blessing over you and you can be dismissed.

May the Lord bless you and keep you.
May he make his face to shine upon you and give you grace.

May cause his favor to chase you down all the days of your life and may you dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen
