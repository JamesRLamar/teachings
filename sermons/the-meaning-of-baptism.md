title: The Meaning of Baptism
---


Baptism was a ritual established before John and before Jesus came to earth. Baptism was a symbol established when the Hebrews came through the Red Sea and when they came through the Jordan River. It was also a ritual meant to symbolize the transformation of someone from changed from a common person to a holy priest.

We don't merely die to our sin we die to ourselves. And we are resurrected to something new as well. We die, and Christ is "put on" or resurrected within us. We no longer live for ourselves but for Christ. In some traditions, people are actually given new names after they are baptized to symbolize their transformation.

**Romans 6:3-4**

Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

**Romans 13:14**

But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.

**Baptism Discourse**

Today you acknowledge publically that you are a sinner deserving of judgment, but who has fully trusted in Yeshua and sacrifice to be enough to cleanse you of your sin, and to give you a new life. Today you acknowledge you have been bought with a great price through the blood of Yeshua and you surrender all that you are, your life, your love, your sin, your selfish desires. Today you declare you wish to die to your old self and be made new in the perfect image of our Messiah.

Do you understand and acknowledge all these things I have said?

Upon your profession of faith in Yeshua, I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

Leviticus 16:4 tells us, “He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body; he is to tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are sacred garments; so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on.”
