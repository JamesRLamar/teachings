## Core Concepts
- **Shabbat** = to cease, not just rest
- **Made for man** - gift, not burden
- **Sign between God and His people**
- **Created at Creation** - before Sinai
- **Eternal commandment** - not abolished
- **Rest from works** - physical and spiritual

## Common Objections Addressed
- "Sabbath was only for Jews" → Made for all mankind
- "Paul abolished Sabbath" → Paul kept Sabbath with Gentiles
- "Sunday replaced Saturday" → No biblical basis
- "Sabbath is legalism" → Gift of rest and relationship

## Practical Application
- Cease from regular work
- Focus on God and family
- Physical and spiritual rest
- Preparation on sixth day
- Holy, set apart time
