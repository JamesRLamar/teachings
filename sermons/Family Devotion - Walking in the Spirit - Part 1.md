**This week’s main point:**
What you feed grows

**‭‭Galatians‬ ‭5:21-23 ‭NKJV‬‬**

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.”

What separates our fruit from the fruit the world bears is out motive. The “why” behind what we do determines whether we end up looking just like the world or truly stand out as salt and light. Are we devoted to these things? Devotion is not measured by saying “yes" to everything, but by understanding what to say “no” to. We simply have a limited capacity of what things we can truly be devoted to and we must choose wisely.

**What does love look like?**

**What does the opposite of love look like?**

**How do we feed love?**
