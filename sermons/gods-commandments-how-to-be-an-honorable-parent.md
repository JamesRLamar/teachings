title: God's Commandments How to be an Honorable Parent
---



**Exodus 20:12**
Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.

**Proverbs 22:6 TS2009**
Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not turn from it.

**Train** - comes from root word choker or noose, the actual word refers to wetting the palate of a baby with something sweet to get them to nurse. It is also used in the sense of leading or training a horse by using a rope attached to a bit in it's mouth.

**The way** - the journey

**Turn from it** - tor turn away or reject because something is sour

# Make a way

- As they mature give away power to decisions that have bearable consequences
- Let your children strategically struggle
- Promote wisdom not perfection
- Wisdom means learning from other people's mistakes, but give grace and room for your children to make mistakes. Even the same mistakes you made.
- Why? You must trust the process of learning and you must ultimately trust God to be their Father. You are merely a proxy and shepherd.

# Teach The Way

- Be consistent in what you communicate and communicate what you expect
- Discipline is a form of communication, but softly spoken words are the most powerful tool we have. Those words have to be consistent and backed up with action should a child choose to be disobedient.
- Have difficult conversations often so you won't have to have difficult conversations very often.
- Learn your child

# Live The Way

- The goal of successful parenting to children that are not dependent on you but are dependent on God.
- Be the example you want them to be in word, in deed, in motivation. They will follow your example regardless of what you want for them.
- Don't live vicariously
- Be honest with your mistakes
- Be a master of self, not a slave to sin


Keep in mind this lesson is not meant to condemn or guilt anyone. We all have moments that we parent well and moments that we do not. The intention here is to motivate you to parent from faith not fear. Maybe you had a bad parenting moment just this morning, if so, one of my points is to admit when we fail and demonstrate repentance and humility to our children.

# How do you know if you are parenting our of Fear or Faith?

1. Do you admit when you are wrong? Do you own poor choices and repent before your children?
2. Do you yell instead or instruct?
3. Do you cast vision or cast down?
4. Do you discipline consistently or only when you've had enough?
5. Do you give space for faith? Do you make room for children to make mistakes and for "bad" things to happen?
