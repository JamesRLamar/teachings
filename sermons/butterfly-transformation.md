**Romans 12:2**

And do not be like the other people in this **world**, but be **transformed** by the **renewing** of your mind, that you may live for the perfect will of God.

The word transformed means metamorphosis. Does anyone know what metamorphosis means?

What are some of the bad behaviors of some of your friends?

"And do not be like the other people in this **world**..."

How should we act if we love God and know we are loved by Him?

What happens if we say we love God, but then act just like all the people who don't?

What is the perfect will of God for us?
