**Object lesson:**

**Have the children decorate one of the parents like a Christmas tree. Each object should represent something valuable and rich. This should be fun. Later, You could write certain words on name tags and stick those to the parent as you talk about how we honor our parents. Have the parent stand during the lesson. **

**Quiz the children to see if anyone can remember the first four commandments. **

Have a child read the 5th Commandment:

“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you.”

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭20:12‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

**The word honor means to make weighty or rich with blessing. This parent being decorated like a Christmas tree is a picture of what it means to honor our parents. Of course, we had fun with this, but when we honor our parents it means we give them very special respect. It’s not just listening to them it’s making them rich and honored. It also means as they get older that we care for them out of our own wealth as they cared for us when we were young. **

**The Commandments are divided into two tablets. On the first tablet, is the first commandment and the remaining four commandments are how we keep the first commandment to love God. ****So the fifth commandment, honor your parents, is an expression of our love for God and it is part of keeping the first commandment. **

**Why do we honor our earthy father and mother?**

**What are some ways we can honor our parents? Wrote these things on name tags and stick to the parent**

**What would it look like to dishonor our parents?**

**See if the children have any questions. **

**Have one of the children pray for the parents and then join together in singing a worship song. **
