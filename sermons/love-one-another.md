> Love is more than what we say,  
> It’s how we live from day to day.  
> To love ourselves yet hate our brother,  
> Is to serve the one and scorn the other.

>“For the commandments, ‘You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,’ and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” (Romans 13:9)

**John 13:34**
“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.”

**Hebrews 10:24–25**
“And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.”

**John 13:14**
“If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.”

**1 John 3:11**
“For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.”

**1 Peter 4**
7 But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers. 

8 And above all things have fervent love for one another, for “love will cover a multitude of sins.” 

9 Be hospitable to one another without grumbling. 

10 As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 

11 If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
