Who here knows what a judge is?

What does a judge do?

- Holds people accountable for breaking laws
- Why do we have laws?

“Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.” So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.”

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭1‬:‭8‬-‭11‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.””

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭1‬:‭22‬ ‭NIV‬‬

““But I know that the King of Egypt (Pharaoh) is not going to let you go, not even by a strong hand. “And I shall stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I shall do in its midst. And after that he shall let you go.”

‭‭Shemoth (Exodus)‬ ‭3‬:‭19‬-‭20‬ ‭TS2009‬‬

You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land.

But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment. The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them.”

Exodus 7:2-5 (ESV)

What do you think it means to be just?

Just = Righteous (good) in the eyes of God.

Is Pharaoh’s treatment of the Israelite people just?
Is God just in His judgement and punishment of Egypt and Pharaoh?

Does God act like a judge upholding the laws he created? Are his laws just?

If we break any one of God’s commands, which are the laws of spiritual life, are we then subject to God’s judgement as well? Has anyone ever perfectly kept all of God’s laws?

What has Jesus done for us instead of leaving us to the judgment we have earned?
