**What does it look like to be obedient and have faith in God?**

**John 12:25**

He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.

**John 12:26**

If anyone **serves** Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My **servant** will be also. If anyone **serves** Me, him My Father will **honor**.

"Serve" means to labor or till the ground. It means to attend to as in waiting a table.

"Honor" means to ascribe worth and value.

It is in serving God that we find and are ascribed part of our worth. It's not enough to know how valuable we are because we are created in His image. We are called on a mission. We have purpose.

**What if Abraham insisted that he had faith in God, but never left his homeland as God commanded?**

**What if Moses heard the call from the burning bush, but never went back to confront Pharaoh?**

**
**

**What if David made the claim that God could give him victory over Goliath, but never picked up his sling to fight?**

To fear God is to trust God. To trust God is to have faith in Him.

**Faith** isn't quiet.

**Faith** inspires respect and provokes persecution.

**Faith** comforts the disturbed and disturbs the comfortable.

**Serving** God will require something of you. Remember, if you're not **stretching** you're not **serving**.
