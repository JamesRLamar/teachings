**Genesis 37:2-11**

2 This is the history of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought a bad report of them to his father.

3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age. Also he made him a tunic of many colors. 4 But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.

5 Now Joseph had a dream, and he told it to his brothers; and they hated him even more. 6 So he said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: 7 There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.”

8 And his brothers said to him, “Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.

9 Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, “Look, I have dreamed another dream. And this time, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.”

10 So he told it to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall your mother and I and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the earth before you?” 11 And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the matter in mind.

**Summarize the story of Joseph**
Joseph was:

- Hated by his brothers
- Sold into slavery
- Falsely accused by his master’s wife of hurting her
- Thrown into prison
- Forgotten for 2 years in prison before God promoted him to second in command in the world
- Interpreted another dream and saved the world from starvation, including his whole family

**Read the following verses:**

So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house and in the field. (‭Genesis‬ ‭39‬:‭5‬ NKJV)

But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him mercy, and He gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. (‭Genesis‬ ‭39‬:‭21‬ NKJV)

**Joseph speaking to his brothers after he saved them from the famine:**

So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. (‭Genesis‬ ‭45‬:‭8‬ NKJV)

As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive. (‭Genesis‬ ‭50‬:‭20‬ NASB)
