**1 John 2**

15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.

18 Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour.

28 And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.

So Jesus has announced He is about to come back.

We need to take serious inventory of our lives. We need to be sure we will be unashamed at his coming. He won’t say exactly what day he is coming back, but he wants us to prepare now. It’s very important that we no longer delay and we don’t allow ourselves to get distracted.

Over the coming months different people are going to be reaching out to you because they will have no idea how to have a meaningful relationship with Jesus without the Church as they have known it. They will need you to show them the way.

What are the most important things you need to teach them? What are the things that matter most?

What example have you yet to fulfill in your own life? Where do you need to step up and focus better?

Is there anything you would be ashamed about if His return happened later today?

Let’s get things right and get ready for the most exciting time in history!
