' Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was from Kabzeel and was a brave man who did many things. He killed two distinguished soldiers from Moab. He also went into a cistern and killed a lion on the day it snowed. He killed an eight-foot-tall Egyptian. The Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam in his hand. But Benaiah went to him with a club, grabbed the spear away from him, and killed him with it. These are the things that Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, did. He was as famous as the three fighting men.

Most people are afraid of dying. Some people are more afraid of not living for something worth dying for.

Chronicles is a summary of the lives of mankind since Adam. Some people are remembered as heroes. Others are remembered as cheats and cowards. It’s inspiring to read about the righteous and brave. It’s sobering to read about those who sold their God given destiny for crumbs. We ought to learn from their examples good and bad. We ought to decide for ourselves now, while we still have life in us how we want to be remembered.

How would you like to be remembered? What things would you want to live for that are worth dying for?
