1. The man of God is On Time
2. The man of God Redeems the Time
3. The man of God Respects God’s Timing

**The man of God is On Time**
**
**

**Being late is a lesser form of not showing up at all. It not only shows we value our time more highly than others, but it shows disrespect for others time. It shows preference for ourselves alone.**

**
**
**Philippians 2:3-4**

Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.

**Romans 12:10**

Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another

**The man of God Redeems the Time**
**
**

**To redeem the time, it ransom every second for God’s eternal purpose. It means valuing our time, and making no compromise to ever waste it. Wasting time is nothing but foolishness.**

**Ephesians 5:15-21**

15 See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, **redeeming** the time, because the days are evil.

17 Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 18 And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit,

21 submitting to one another in the fear of God.
