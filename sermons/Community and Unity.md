**Psalm 133:1**

**John 13:34**

A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another

**John 13:35**

By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another

**Matthew 20**

25 But Jesus called them to Himself and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them.

26 Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant.

27 And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave—

28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”

**Romans 12:10**

Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another

**1 Peter 1:22**

Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently with a pure heart

**1 Thessalonians 4:1**

Finally then, brethren, we urge and exhort in the Lord Jesus that you should ***abound more and more***, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God

**1 Thessalonians 4:9**

But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I should write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another

**1 Thessalonians 4:10**

and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, that you ***increase more and more***

**Ephesians 4**

1 I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called,

2 with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love,

3 endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,

12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,

13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God...

15 but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ

16 ...according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.

**How are we to love one another?**
**
**
**How did Jesus show love to His disciples?**
**
**
**In what ways do we excel as a Church in serving/loving one another?**
**
**
**In what ways can we “abound more and more?”**
