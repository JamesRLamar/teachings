The Vatican is one of the last remaining absolute monarchies and theocracies in the world.

The Vatican is a nation.

The Vatican is the capital city of the Roman Catholic Church, which claims to be the One True Church.

The Roman Catholic Church is ruled by the pope who has several titles and names.

Titles for the pope:

- Roman Pontiff
- Holy Father
- Holy See
- Vicar of Christ or Vicar of God

# **Roman Pontiff**

Meaning: Roman High-Priest or Bridge-Maker

**Hebrews 7:26-28**

For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens; who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the people’s, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints the Son who has been perfected forever.

**Holy Father**

**Matthew 23:8-10**

But you, do not be called ‘Rabbi’; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brethren. Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ.

# **Holy See**

Meaning: Holy Chair

In terms of actual governance, the Holy See refers specifically to the position of the Holy Father, who “by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, namely, and as pastor of the entire Church, has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered” (Dogmatic Constitution of the Church, #22).

There is an actual bronze chair in Saint Peter's Basilica that is called the Holy See, which is considered the throne of the pope in the "Temple of God"

**Vicar of Christ or Vicar of God**
Meaning: Substitute of God

In the Liber Pontificalis of Pope Leo III (795-816), the following prescript is recorded: “Nos sedem apostolicam, quae est caput omnium Dei ecclesiarum judicare non audemus” (“We dare not judge the Apostolic See, which is the head of all the Churches of God”)

**2 Thessalonians 2:1-2**

Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come.

**2 Thessalonians 2:3-4**

Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits [c]as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.

**Colossians 1:15**
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.

**Colossians 1:18**

And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.

**Revelation 17**
