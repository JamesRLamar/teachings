**Hebrews 5:12–14**
> "For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
### Prayer
 
1. **Matthew 6:9-13**

2. **Philippians 4:6-7**

### 1. **Inspired by the _Amidah_** (Standing Prayer)

> "Blessed are You, Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty, and awesome God, God Most High, who bestows lovingkindness, and is Master of all, who remembers the righteousness of the righteous and brings a redeemer to their children’s children, for His name’s sake with love. King, Helper, Savior, and Shield, Blessed are You, Lord, Shield of Israel. We praise You for Your unending faithfulness and steadfast love. Establish Your kingdom among us, and may Your will be done in our lives. Bless us with all we need today—our daily bread, wisdom, and strength. Bring us back, our Father, to Your Torah, and draw us near, our King, to Your service, and cause us to return in perfect repentance before You. Blessed are You, Lord, who desires repentance. Forgive us, our Father, for we have sinned; pardon us, our King, for we have willfully transgressed. For You pardon and forgive. Blessed are You, Lord, the gracious One who forgives abundantly. Lead us by Your Spirit into paths of righteousness. May Your name be glorified now and forever. Amen."
