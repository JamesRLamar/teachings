title: Feast of Tabernacles Discourse
---



As we come together to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles, let's pause and reflect on the profound lessons this ancient festival has for us today.

# Yahweh is Our Shepherd

First, it's a vivid illustration that calls us to be content and thankful in all circumstances, knowing that Yahweh is our true shelter and provider. We must never become so entangled with the luxuries and conveniences of this world that we lose sight of the God who shelters and provides, the God who comforts and guides.

**1 Thessalonians 5:18**
Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.

**Psalm 23**
1 Yahweh is my shepherd, I do not lack.  
2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,  
3 He refreshes my soul.  He guides me along righteous paths for his name’s sake.

# This World is Not Our Home
Have you ever stopped to consider why God instructed the Israelites to live in short-term shelters? What does dwelling in a tent— a structure designed to be impermanent—teach us about our walk with God?

It serves as a poignant reminder of our spiritual journey here on Earth. Our time here is temporary, and like the Israelites in the desert, we too are on a pilgrimage towards a Promised Land. The transience of the tent echoes the transient nature of life itself.

**1 John‬ ‭2:15-17‬**
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.

# We Will Dwell with Him Forever
We should not just remember what Tabernacles causes us to recall, but look to what Tabernacles foreshadows. It foreshadows a day when God will eternally dwell or tabernacle with His people. When heaven and earth will be one and we will celebrate the Last Tabernacles as a wedding feast together with Him.

**Philippians 3:20**
For our citizenship is in the heavens, from which we also eagerly wait for the Saviour, the Master Yeshua Messiah.

**Revelation 21**
1 Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 

3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God _is_ with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them _and be_ their God. 

4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”

So tonight, as we dine under a tabernacle, let us remember this Day as a day of thankfulness and day to renew our focus on things eternal.
