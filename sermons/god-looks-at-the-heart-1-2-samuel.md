---


***Family Emphasis***
**Illustration**:

Fold a $20 bill as many times as you can and wrap it in a very small package. Wrap a big empty box and add all sorts of pretty bows and such. Ask the children which gift looks more valuable. Have them talk about what kinds of things could be in each package. Have them open the packages after reading the scriptures and answering questions to reveal the true value of each gift.

**This week’s main point:**
People look at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.** **

**Scriptures to read:**

“But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have refused him. For the LORD does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.””

‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭16:7‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah.”

‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭16:13‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and a distressing spirit from the LORD troubled him.”

‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭16:14‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“Then one of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the LORD is with him.””

‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭16:18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

# Questions:

Why did everyone seem to think the next king would be one of Jesse’s older sons?

What kind of person was God looking for?
Who was David before God showed favor to him in front of everyone?
What can we learn from this story about what kind of people we should be?

- Our motives are selfish
- We are not in a place we can hear His voice

- Seek counsel from trusted sources
- Then wait until we feel His peace and discern His will
