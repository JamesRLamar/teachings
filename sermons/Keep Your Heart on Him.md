**Isaiah‬ ‭41:10‬ **

Fear not, for **I am** with you; be not dismayed, for **I am** your God. **I will** strengthen you, yes, **I will** help you, **I will** uphold you with My righteous right hand.

**Colossians‬ ‭3:23-24‬**

And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.

"Whatever you do" - all things you make, perform, produce, commit

"Heartily" - emanating from the heart

"Lord" - The Master

"Knowing" - to perceive, to discern, to pay attention to

"From the Lord" - emanating from an origin, coming forth from The Master

"Reward" - payment for suffering or promise from service

"Inheritance" - eternal blessedness

"Serve" - to be a slave

- You are not a slave to sin
- You are not a slave to man's opinion
- You are not a slave to man's expectations
- You ARE a slave to the Master

**Isaiah 26:3**

**You** will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on **You**, because he trusts in **You**.

"Keep" - as a watchman, to preserve, to guard with fidelity, to keep from all danger

"In Perfect Peace" - this is actually the word Shalom repeated three times which means peace, health, tranquility, and friendship

"Mind" - the thoughts which spring forth from the heart

"Stayed" - established and sustained

"Trusts" - bold confidence to the point of carelessness

The word "You" does not actually appear in this verse

Hebrew,  "Nasar Shalom Shalom Shalom, yeser samak, ki batah"

Paraphrase of the Hebrew, "The thoughts streaming from the heart, established and sustained, of those who trust with bold confidence, are shielded by The Watchman. To them be Peace Peace Peace."

**Proverbs‬ ‭4:23‬**
Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life.

**Psalm 34:4**
I sought the LORD, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears

**Psalm 34:17**

The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles
