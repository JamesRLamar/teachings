**Who won the game?**

**Who lost the game?**

**Who had fun?**

**Matthew 16:26 NKJV**

For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?

**Matthew 16:26 Para**

What good is it if you win the whole world, and yet lose your soul? Or what earthly trophy could ever be worth as much as your soul?

**Colossians 3:2-10 NKJV**
Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth.

**Matthew 6:25-34**

25 Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?

26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?

27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?

28 And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not work. Yet not even Solomon in all his power was dressed as well as a flower.

31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For unbelievers chase after these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.

33 But seek first his eternal kingdom and his righteousness, and all these earthly things will be given to you as well.

**Ecclesiastes 2:24-25 ERV**

There is no one who has tried to enjoy life more than I have. And this is what I learned: The best thing people can do is eat, drink, and enjoy the work they do. I saw that this comes from God.
