## 1 - Our Lives Are a Gift to God

What does it mean to love God with our lives?

Many equate loving God with avoiding sin, but God calls us to daily submission to His will. True love for God is not just about avoiding wrong actions but about offering ourselves as a living sacrifice in alignment with His purpose.

**Romans 12:1-2 (NKJV)**  
"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."

## 2 - Beware of Surface Sacrifice

### The Story of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11, NKJV)

Ananias and his wife Sapphira sold a piece of property, and they conspired to **withhold a portion of the proceeds** while pretending to give the full amount as an offering to the apostles. Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, confronts Ananias, asking him why he chose to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the money. As a result of their deceit, both Ananias and Sapphira fall dead in front of the apostles, causing great fear to spread through the early Christian community.

Are there areas in your life where you are only partially surrendered to God, while outwardly presenting yourself as fully committed?

## 3 - Partial Obedience Is Complete Rebellion

### The Story of Achan (Joshua 7)

After the fall of Jericho, God commanded the Israelites to **devote all the spoils of Jericho to Him** (*Joshua 6:18-19*). However, **Achan** secretly kept some of the devoted items for himself, burying them in his tent while pretending to obey God’s command fully. As a result of his disobedience, Israel lost the next battle at Ai, and it was revealed that Achan’s sin had brought judgment upon the entire nation.

Is your partial obedience hurting your family, your church, or the lost members of your community?

**Isaiah 30:1 (NKJV)**  
"Woe to the rebellious children, says the Lord, who take counsel, but not of Me, and who devise plans, but not of My Spirit, that they may add sin to sin."

- **Hebrew for "rebellious"**: The word used here is **סֹרְרִים ("sorerim")**, which means obstinate, defiant, or stubborn. The rebellion here is against God’s will; this resistance was a common theme in Isaiah’s prophecies.
- In Isaiah’s time, Israel was often rebellious, making political alliances (such as with Egypt) rather than trusting in God.

## 4 - The Sacrifice That Truly Pleases God

### The Story of Saul’s Disobedience (1 Samuel 15:1-23)

God, through the prophet Samuel, commands Saul to **completely destroy** the Amalekites and all their possessions as an act of divine judgment (*1 Samuel 15:3*). However, Saul **partially obeys** the command, sparing the Amalekite king, Agag, and keeping the best of the livestock, supposedly for a "sacrifice" to the Lord (*1 Samuel 15:9, 15*).

When Samuel confronts Saul about this disobedience, Saul defends his actions, claiming that the **livestock was spared to offer as sacrifices** to God. Samuel’s response is sharp and significant:

**1 Samuel 15:22-23 (NKJV)**  
"Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He also has rejected you from being king."

**Psalm 51:17**  
"My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise."

If your life is an offering to Him, what does that offering look like?

## 5 - Do Not Despise Small Beginnings

**Zechariah 4:10**  
"For who has despised the day of small things?"

- Zechariah 4:10 reminds us that small beginnings—those modest, seemingly insignificant steps of obedience—are not to be underestimated. Even if progress seems slow or the results are not immediately visible, God values the heart behind these acts of faithfulness.
    
- Zechariah 4:10, in its context, encourages the rebuilding of the temple during a time when the work seemed insignificant compared to its former glory. The people were discouraged by the smallness of their efforts. However, God reassures them that He oversees the work and that small beginnings are significant in His plan. Similarly, the day-to-day acts of submission—those "small sacrifices" we make to align our hearts with God’s—are deeply valued and part of a much larger work He is doing in us.

What small beginning have you been holding back from God?
