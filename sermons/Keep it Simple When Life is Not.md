**Exodus 14:10 NKJV**

And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord.

**Exodus‬ ‭14:11-12‬ ‭ERV‬‬**

They said to Moses, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Did you bring us out here in the desert to die? We could have died peacefully in Egypt; there were plenty of graves in Egypt. We told you this would happen! In Egypt we said, ‘Please don’t bother us. Let us stay and serve the Egyptians.’ It would have been better for us to stay and be slaves than to come out here and die in the desert.”

‭‭
**Exodus 14:13-14 NKJV**

And Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall see again no more forever. The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.”

**Exodus 14:15-16 NKJV**

And the Lord said to Moses, “Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward. But lift up your staff, and ***stretch out your hand***…

Do you see a real problem in front of you? Are you concerned about how you’re going to solve the trouble staring you in the face? Whatever issues are present, I doubt it compares to the terror Israel saw as Pharaoh was closing in from all sides with the mightiest army on earth. Yet, fear is fear and worry is worry. So it doesn’t really matter if your trouble includes being killed before sunset. Whatever you’re facing is a real problem even if it’s not as dire as Israel’s predicament.

So how will you choose to react to your problems?

Israel complained to God, then they complained to Moses, then they just gave up hope entirely. Moses records a very brave and inspiring short speech in verse 13-14, but then the Lord says in verse 15 to Moses, “Why do you cry to Me?”. God reminded Moses that He had already given him everything he needs. “Lift up your staff and stretch out your hand”, the Lord tells him. “Why do you cry to Me when I’ve already told you what you’re supposed to do?"

When there are unsolvable trials in our life, the temptation is to complain and lose hope. Sometimes we yell at God, sometimes we yell at God’s leaders. Sometimes as leaders we yell at our people or we even yell at ourselves. We yell and complain when we lose sight of God and forget about what He has already given us.

Moses might have scoffed at God when he told him to stretch out his staff over the sea. Moses might have thought for a moment what a dumb little toy that staff was compared to the problem in front of him. He may have thought, “Sure the staff did the trick when I was just doing tricks that even Pharaoh’s sorcerers could do, but what is this staff going to do for me now?!”

A reminder, no matter how serious your situation is, don't lose hope and don't lose sight of what God has already put in your hands. It may seem simple, but that’s the point. The tools God gives us are simple in order that we be spared pride when God works powerfully through us. Who would believe a piece of wood could divide an ocean? No matter one's bo-staff-skills, a piece of wood could NEVER do such a thing. And neither can we do anything supernatural by our natural gifts, but with God all things are possible.

Consider how many times God saved millions through the obedience of one person.

The call might be simple, but it is enough for God to do great things if we’ll only remain faithful to “stretch out our hand” and let God be God.

**In what ways do you need to just "stretch out your hand" and let God be God?**
