# Loving Your Neighbor as Yourself: When Enough Is Enough

> "Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these." (Mark 12:29-31)

The command seems simple enough: love your neighbor as yourself. But there's a hidden assumption buried in those words. Before you can love your neighbor *as yourself*, you must first believe that you are worthy of being loved. And before you can believe you're worthy of love, you must believe that God is enough, and that in Him, you are enough.

## The Masterpiece

Picture a master craftsman standing before his finished work. He's spent days, weeks, months bringing his vision to life. Every detail is perfect. Every line is intentional. Every color is exactly as it should be. He steps back, examines his creation from every angle, and with complete satisfaction, he says, "It is very good."

Then imagine someone walking up to that masterpiece and saying, "Yes, but don't you think it needs something more? Maybe a bit more color here? Or a different shape there?" The craftsman would be offended, wouldn't he? Not because the criticism is harsh, but because it's missing the point entirely. The work is complete. It is finished. It is enough because he says it is.

This is what God declared over creation when He finished His work. "Very good." Not "almost perfect," or "needs improvement." Very good. Complete. Finished. Enough.

**How can we truly love others if we're still trying to prove we're enough to ourselves?**

### 1. When "Enough" Becomes Rebellion

> "Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was **very good**. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day." (Genesis 1:31 emphasis added)

**To be enough means there's nothing to add and nothing to take away.** 
This is why God ceased when He finished creation and declared it "very good", not because it was perfect in our human sense, but because it was complete, sufficient, and exactly what He intended it to be.

When God finished creating, He didn't keep tinkering. He didn't add another star or another species. He ceased. He rested. It was God's way of saying, "This is enough."

But here's where we get into trouble. We look at ourselves, and we think, "I'm not enough. I need to be smarter, stronger, richer, better." We look at others and think, "They're not enough. They need to change, to improve, to become who I think they should be." And in doing so, we're not just disagreeing with our own assessment, but with God's as well.

When we don't believe God is enough or we are enough, we pretend. When we pretend, we strive. Striving isn't ambition or excellence. **Striving is rebellion against the goodness of God.** 

When we strive to become "enough" through our own efforts, we're essentially telling God that His declaration of "very good" over creation—and over us—wasn't right. We're saying, "You were wrong, God. I'm not enough. Your love isn't enough. Your grace isn't enough."

**In what areas of your life are you still striving to prove you're enough?**

**Where do you struggle the most to believe God is enough, and you are enough?**

### 2. When Shame Rejects God's Image

> "So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, 'It is finished!' And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit." (John 19:30)

After Jesus died on the Cross, consider two men who both failed Jesus spectacularly. Both sinned grievously. Both betrayed their Lord in moments of weakness. But only one found their way back.

Peter denied Jesus three times. Three times he looked his friend and teacher in the eye and said, "I don't know Him." When the rooster crowed, he remembered Jesus' words and went out, weeping bitterly. But Peter repented not just by accepting his failure, but by accepting Christ's forgiveness. Later, Jesus appeared to him. He restored him. Peter went on to lead the early church.

Judas also betrayed Jesus, but with a kiss. He sold his Lord for thirty pieces of silver. And when he realized what he had done, he tried to return the money. But when that didn't crush the shame, instead of accepting both his failure and Christ's forgiveness, he went out and hanged himself.

What was the difference? Both men sinned. Both felt the weight of their failure. Peter trusted that God's love was enough. Judas simply could not.

**Shame and self-hatred are not humility. They are a rejection of the image of God in us.** When we look in the mirror and see only failure, only inadequacy, only unworthiness, we're not seeing reality. We're seeing a distortion. And that distortion says to God, "You were wrong to create me. You were wrong to call me 'very good.' Your image in me is not enough. Your love is not enough."

But God doesn't see us through the lens of our failures. He sees us through the finished work of the cross. He sees us as "very good" because He made us and redeemed us. And when Jesus said, "It is finished," He wasn't just talking about His suffering; He was talking about our sufficiency in Him. We are complete. We are enough.

**How often does shame help restore our relationship with God?**

**What's a better response than shame?**

### 3. When Prayer Changes Our Vision

> "But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you." (Matthew 5:44)

**Only once we accept that God is enough and that we are enough in Him, can we practically love others as we love ourselves.** Only then will we see them through God's eyes: "very good," worthy of love, created in His image.

But what do we do when people really aren't living up to the "very good" part yet? What do we do when they're still broken, still hurting, still lashing out? When they insult us, or offend us, or continue a pattern of sin?

**We pray for them.**

Prayer does two things, but only one of them is obvious. 

1. **Prayer asks God to help them in their need to grow.** We're interceding on their behalf, asking the Father to move in their hearts, to heal their wounds, to break their chains.

2. **Prayer helps our hearts change while we wait for their hearts to change.** When we pray with *hope* and not doubt, we begin to see them not as they are, but as they will be. We see them through God's eyes as complete, as "very good," as worthy of love. We do this by visualizing the future change. We need a vision of the healed and restored version of them.

And when we see them this way, we can smile with genuine kindness at their continued insults or offense, not because we're naive or in denial, but because our hearts have already been transformed.

**Who in your life needs your prayers, both for you and for them?**

## Closing

The command to love your neighbor as yourself requires two foundational beliefs: that God is enough, and that in Him, we are enough.

When we embrace these two truths, something beautiful happens. We stop striving. We stop pretending. We stop rejecting the image of God in ourselves. And then we can begin to see that same image in others, even when it's covered by layers of hurt, sin, and brokenness.

You are enough because God says you are. 

Your neighbor is enough because God says they are. 

And love is simply the act of agreeing with God about both of you.
