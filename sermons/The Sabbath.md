How do we keep the Sabbath?
Should we keep the Sabbath?
Should we keep the Ten Commandments?

The Sabbath is made for man
What does that mean?
What are reasons people don't keep the Sabbath?

- It doesn't matter
- It's inconvenient
- It's an emergency

Genesis 1
The stars were made first for signs and for seasons(feasts)
What do the stars and moon have to do with the feasts?
What they have to do with signs?
The feasts are part of the sign of God's people

Is the Sabbath is holy? Why or why not?
Genesis 2
Those things God blessed bore fruit and multiplied

Shabbat means to cease. It is not merely about resting, it is about ceasing. It is not as much about what you do, it is more about what you don't do.

Keep it clean, pure, holy

Genesis 12:2
Those that are blessed are also a blessing
Genesis 12:3

Those that are blessed, have special favor with God and He will bless those who bless His blessed ones
