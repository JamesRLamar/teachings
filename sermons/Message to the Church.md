I see that you love one another. I see that you care for each other and pray for each other and open your homes to one another. 

There is community. There is a safe place to share and grow and learn. 

Your children know first hand what it looks like to pray and worship and to fellowship. They see that faith is a family and whole church affair. 

You are a people who honor the Sabbath and remember the Feasts of Yahweh. You honor His sacrifice on Passover. You look to heaven on Trumpets. You are a people who watch expectantly for His coming. 

There are times you stray or lose focus, but you are quick to refocus, to ask for counsel, and to follow wisdom. You are a people who consistently and persistently recenter your lives on the only One who matters. 

Though you struggle and toil and feel lost at times. You fast, you pray, you seek, you knock and God has always been faithful to answer. 

And yetâ€¦

There is more. 

You have more to learn and more to teach. You have more to give and more to forgive. You have more love to pour out and more people to pour love on. There are more words that need to be spoken and more words that need to be heeded and obeyed. 

Do not grow weary and do not grow complacent, because there is more. And let me add, be more urgent. For godly urgency combats the slow decay of spiritual apathy and lethargy. 

Urgently arise in the morning and seek Him first. Urgently pray for your neighbors and open your ears, open your hearts, and open your homes in these last hours. Urgently fast. Urgently seek His will in all things knowing your life is not your own, your finances are not your own, even your children are not your own. 

He has shepherded you well, so go be like the Good Shepherd to others. Settle not for where you are or where you have been, for there is indeed more that is expected and more that you are capable of. 

Be His Holy Church without spot or blemish. Be His Perfect Bride eagerly awaiting His arrival found faithful to all He commanded. Be nothing less than those purchased by the blood of the Only Son of God and walk worthy of the calling in which you have received.
