Proprioception is the ability to sense the location of your body in space.

With good proprioception, your body can sense the slightest off-balance or misalignment and make adjustments to become centered again.

Proprioception in weight lifting is exceptionally important as you must be able to stay perfectly balanced while moving heavy weight. Not being able to accurately sense where you are can lead to serious injury or a serious accident.

When performing the squat or deadlift, there is the concept of "rooting" your feet into the ground so you can activate all 200,000 nerve endings in your foot. That is proprioception.

You must learn to root yourself so you can have an awareness of yourself and make proper adjustments to stay strong and balanced.

Mikveh - hope, confidence, or a pool of water to be cleansed in (baptismal).

Mikveh comes from the root word "qavah", which means to bind together by twisting, like roots.

Baptism is a symbol of drawing from a new source of life.

Example: the crossing of the Red Sea, even though freed slaves, they would no longer get provision from Egypt.

Example: the crossing of the Jordan River, even though entering into the Promised Land, they would no longer get provision from manna in the wilderness.

And in both of those examples, how hard was it for them to cross back over the river or sea in the way in which God brought them?

**Jeremiah 17**
5 Thus says the Lord:
Cursed is the man who trusts in man
And makes flesh his strength,
Whose heart departs from the Lord.

6 For he shall be like a shrub in the desert,
And shall not see when good comes,
But shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,
In a salt land which is not inhabited.

7 Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord,
And whose hope is the Lord.

8 For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters,
Which spreads out its roots by the river,
And will not fear when heat comes;
But its leaf will be green,
And will not be anxious in the year of drought,
Nor will cease from yielding fruit.

These verses contrast those who trust in man versus those who trust in Yahweh as being one kind of plant that is dead and dry in a parched land versus a tree that is rooted by streams of living water. This is also the symbol of baptism(mikveh) which is directly correlated in verse 13.

13 O Lord, the **hope** of Israel,
All who forsake You shall be **ashamed**.
Those who depart from Me
Shall be written in the earth,
Because they have forsaken the Lord,
**The fountain of living waters**.

The word "hope" in the last verse is mikveh. Yahweh is the baptismal of Israel.

The word "ashamed" in the last verse is the picture of a well that has run dry, therefore it is ashamed or disappointed.

**Psalm 1**

**John 7:37-39**

37 On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. 38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.”

39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

**Acts 1:5**

For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit

**Galatians 5**

16 I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.

24 And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

**What it means to be rooted in the Living Water:**

- Being rooted means being able to quickly sense when we are off-balance and easily adjust ourselves to be in line again. How long does it take for you to realize if you've started to stray from Yeshua as your source of Life? Is your life characterized as being full but balanced?
- Being rooted means being firmly set, entangled, or bound. In other words, it's not easy to go back to Egypt. Do you find yourself regularly having to walk back from Egypt? Meaning is every other week or every other month a toss-up of if you lived just like the rest of the world? Or do you walk deeply and authentically in the Spirit?
- Being rooted means drawing life from the source you are rooted in. You do not look for affirmation or confirmation outside the source. Your confidence comes from your source. The test is to ask yourself what do you trust in? What are you confident in? What or whom do you rely on?
- Being rooted means being grounded, consistent, steady, and reliable. You are not a wave tossed to and fro. You are not chaff blown about by the slightest of breeze. Are you the picture of steady? Do you exemplify consistency? How resilient are you when things are difficult, ambiguous, or unexpected?
- Being rooted means you find deep satisfaction in the Truth. You are moved by His Words. You are in awe of His Law. Do you find delight in His Words and precepts? Are you known for regularly walking and talking with Him? Does meditation upon His Word day and night characterize you? Does your schedule reflect a life that puts a relationship with Yeshua as a priority above all else?
- Being rooted in the Living Water means streams of living water flow from you as well. Are you known to pour forth wisdom from above? Do your conversations challenge and inspire change in others? Does your love for others draw others to love Him?
