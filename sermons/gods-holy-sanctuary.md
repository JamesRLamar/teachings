> "And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them." — Exodus 25:8

God has always desired one thing above all else: to dwell with His people. But His presence cannot coexist with impurity. What He required of the Temple, He now requires of our homes and hearts.

## When His Presence Filled the Temple

Once, the Temple in Jerusalem stood in unmatched splendor—its golden sanctuary glowing with holy fire, the inner chamber holding the very presence of Yahweh. At its dedication, fire fell from heaven, and the glory of God filled the house so powerfully that the priests couldn't stand to minister (2 Chronicles 7:1). 

**Reflection:** Has God's glory ever filled your heart or home?

### 1. The Sanctuary Demands Holiness

The Temple was designed with meticulous care: the menorah casting perpetual light, the altar of incense sending up fragrant prayers, the bread of the presence symbolizing God's sustaining provision. Every detail spoke of one truth: God's presence is holy. But what happens when that holiness is violated?

> "Then He said to me, 'Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary?'" — Ezekiel 8:6

**Teaching Point:**
When God's people brought idolatry, sexual sin, and strange worship into the Temple, God's presence could not remain—holiness and defilement cannot coexist.

**Question:**
The Israelites adorned the Temple with symbols of worship to other gods, inviting foreign presences into God's holy place. What are the modern equivalents we invite into our homes through our screens, entertainment, and relationships that grieve the Holy Spirit?

### 2. The Home as a Little Sanctuary

> "Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Although I have cast them far off among the Gentiles, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet I shall be a little sanctuary (mikdash me'at) for them in the countries where they have gone."'" — Ezekiel 11:16

**Teaching Point:**
Even in exile, God promised to be a "little sanctuary" wherever His people gathered. Our homes are meant to be little sanctuaries for God to be worshipped.

#### Additional Context:

In Jewish thought, holiness is not merely an abstract spiritual state but something cultivated in the spaces we inhabit. The Midrash teaches: "Just as the light of the menorah shone in the Mishkan and Temple, so too a person must ensure that their home shines with the light of mitzvot and good deeds" (Midrash Tanchuma, Tetzaveh 5).

Jesus Himself echoed this imagery: "You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket… Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:14–16).

The mezuzah on Jewish doorposts (Deuteronomy 6:9) marks a covenantal boundary—declaring that this home belongs to God. What crosses that threshold—inward or outward—matters deeply.

**Question:**
How can we practically make our homes little sanctuaries?

### 3. The Heart as the Ultimate Sanctuary

> "Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are." — 1 Corinthians 3:16-17

>"Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?"
>
>"And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God."
>
>"As God has said:
'I will dwell in them
And walk among them.
I will be their God,
And they shall be My people.'"

>"Therefore, 'Come out from among them
And be separate, says the Lord.
Do not touch what is unclean,
And I will receive you.'"

>"Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."

(2 Corinthians 6:14–17:1)

**Teaching Point:**
The ultimate sanctuary is not a building but the human heart, making every believer a living temple that must be kept holy. Sexual sin, idolatry, murder, and strange fire are all sins historically committed in the Sanctuary, which had severe punishment.

**Question:**
What are the modern-day equivalents of sin that people bring into their homes?

## Closing

God has always desired to dwell with His people. He designed the Temple with glory and precision. He calls our homes to be little sanctuaries, marked by prayer and devotion. And He makes our very hearts His dwelling place through the Holy Spirit. But in all three spaces, His presence demands one thing: holiness.

The question is not whether God wants to dwell with you; He does. The question is whether you have made a holy space for Him.

When Jesus cleansed the Temple, He declared, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves" (Matthew 21:12–13). If Jesus walked through your home, would He call it a house of prayer, or would He find it mixed with worldly worship?

What have you allowed into your home or heart that grieves the Spirit of God?
