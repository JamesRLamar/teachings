**Proverbs 6:20-23 ERV**

20 My son, remember your father’s command, and don’t forget your mother’s teaching.

21 Remember their words always. Tie them around your neck and keep them over your heart.

22 Let this teaching lead you wherever you go. It will watch over you while you sleep. And when you wake up, it will give you good advice.

23 Your parents give you commands and teachings that are like lights to show you the right way. This teaching corrects you and trains you to follow the path to life.

**Who’s a good listener? Who good at solving puzzles?**

**Are mom and dad sometimes a little better at figuring things out than we are? **

**If you have something you can’t open or you can’t reach, who do you ask for help?**

Let’s play a game were we will test how good you are at listening to your parents.

Blindfold kids and create obstacle course for them to navigate only by the sound of their parents voice.

**What commandment has to do with what we just talked about?**

**Exodus 20:12 **

Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live for a long time in the land the Lord your God is giving you.

**What good comes when we obey and honor our parents?**

**What bad can come when we refuse to listen?**

**If we can’t obey our parents who we can see, how can we expect to obey God whom we can’t see?**
