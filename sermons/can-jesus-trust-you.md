Many people ask, "Do you trust in Jesus?"

But I’d like to ask: Can Jesus trust you?

> "But Jesus did not **commit** Himself to them, because He knew all men,  
and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for He knew what was in man." (John 2:24–25, emphasis added)

The verb translated as “commit” here means to believe, to trust, or to entrust.

Interestingly, this is the same word used just a verse earlier:

> “Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, many **believed** in His name when they saw the signs…” (John 2:23, emphasis added)

So, the people “believed” in Him, but **He did not believe in them**.

_This is not a contradiction. It’s a warning._

Not all faith is saving faith.
Not everyone who “follows” Jesus follows Him.
How many today would **follow** Him on Instagram—
but scroll past His crucifixion for something less confrontational?

We like the Jesus who multiplies bread.
But what will we do with the One who asks us to also pick up our cross?

> He is not looking for fans. He is calling disciples.

Some trusted in Him—but He didn’t trust in them.  

Because He knew their heart.

**Psalm 139:23-24**
>"Search me, O God, and know my heart;  
Try me, and know my anxieties;  
And see if there is any wicked way in me,  
And lead me in the way everlasting."

God already sees your heart.  
There’s no fooling Him.

But are you fooling yourself?

You say you trust in Jesus.  
But can He trust you?

When you look inside, what do you see that's trustworthy?

Does it break your heart to look into your heart?

If it does—you’re not alone. And you’re not without hope.

>"The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart, 
>And saves such as have a contrite spirit." (Psalm 34:18)

>"He heals the brokenhearted 
>And binds up their wounds." (Psalm 147:3)

Jesus doesn’t entrust Himself to the shallow.
But He does draw near to the brokenhearted.
And He welcomes those humble enough to see their need.
