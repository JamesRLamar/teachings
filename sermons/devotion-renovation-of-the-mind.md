title: Devotion Renovation of the Mind
---


**Romans 12:2 TS2009**

And do not be conformed to this world, but be *transformed* by the *renewing* of your mind, so that you prove what is that good and well-pleasing and perfect desire of Elohim.

*Transformed*: transfigured; metamorphosis
*Renew*: renovate

When we renovate, nothing is too sacred not to be discarded.

**Titus 3:5**

not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and *renewing* of the Holy Spirit.

What is the Holy Spirit?
It is God. It is not a mystical force. God is Spirit.

So how can we be renovated by the Spirit of God?

It is only through quiet meditation that we can hear His voice and ponder His thoughts.

**Isaiah 26:3 NKJV**

You will keep him in perfect **peace**, Whose **mind** is stayed on You, Because he **trusts** in You.

**TS2009**

The one steadfast of **mind** You guard in perfect **peace**, for he **trusts** in You.

*Mind*: intent, foundation of our heart and thinking
*Peace*: shalom, the perfect protection and rest only God can assure
*Trust*: to rely on, to have confidence in

**Romans‬ ‭8:6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬**

For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

‭‭
What is the test of where your mind is?
Do you have life and peace?

The key is to learn to recognize the fruit of a mind that has strayed and renew it.

**Transcending Truth** is the key to having peace in a storm.

Imagine, how worried would you be to lose your job if you were already a millionaire?

How worried would you be about sickness if you knew God was going to heal you?

How concerned about anything would you be if you knew the Messiah was coming back soon?

**Containment Steps:**

- Identify the trigger, feelings disproportionate to reality
- Identify the script or automatic thought

- What is the evidence against this thought?
- The contained thought or Transcending Truth

What are some examples of Jesus having the shalom of God in difficult circumstances?

**John 14:27**

Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

God has given you His peace, but what are you doing with it?
