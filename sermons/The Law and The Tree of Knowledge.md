### 1. The Law and The Tree of Knowledge

Romans 3:20 (NKJV) – “By the law is the knowledge of sin.”

Romans 7:7 (NKJV) – “I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, ‘You shall not covet.’”

Galatians 3:19 (NKJV) – “It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made.”

- The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil brought awareness of good and evil, just as the Law of Moses was given to reveal sin (Romans 3:20).
- Adam and Eve didn’t gain righteousness from the tree—they just realized they were sinful and became ashamed.
- Likewise, the Law doesn’t make us righteous—it just shows us that we are sinful.

📖 Galatians 3:24 (NKJV) – _“Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”_

The law was a brutal tutor, showing us only what we could not be apart from Christ. Much like the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, it brought only bad news not good news.

💡 Key Parallel:

- The Tree of Knowledge = The Law (both reveal sin but cannot save).
- The Tree of Life = Jesus (faith in Him brings eternal life).

### 2. The Curse of the Tree and the Curse of the Law

📖 Galatians 3:13 (NKJV) – _“Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree’).”_

- Adam and Eve were cursed when they ate from the tree.
- The Law brings a curse because no one can keep it perfectly (Galatians 3:10).
- Jesus took the curse upon Himself by dying on a tree (the cross), redeeming us from the curse of both!

💡 Key Parallel:

- Adam ate from a tree → Death entered.
- Jesus died on a tree → Life was restored.
- Adam disobeyed at a tree → We fell.
- Jesus obeyed at a tree → We are redeemed.

### 3. Jesus is The Tree of Life (Genesis 3:22-24)

📖 Genesis 3:22-24 (NKJV) – _“Then the Lord God said, ‘Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever’—therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden.”_

- Why did God prevent them from eating the Tree of Life?
    - If they had eaten, they would have lived forever in their fallen state, unable to die and be **born again**.
    - Death became necessary—not as a punishment, but as a way to be redeemed and resurrected.
    - That’s why Jesus says we must be born again (John 3:3).
    - Jesus is the Tree of Life

John 15:4-5 (NKJV) – “Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.”

📖 Revelation 22:2 (NKJV) – _“In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.”_

- The Bible begins and ends with a Tree of Life.
- Adam lost it, Jesus restored it.
- The cross was the bridge back to the Tree of Life.

### Big Idea: Stop Eating from the Wrong Tree!

Instead of trying to be righteous through knowledge and effort (Law, Tree of Knowledge),  
We must receive life by faith in Jesus (Tree of Life).

🔥 Jesus didn’t just remove the curse of the Law—He reversed the curse of the first tree!
