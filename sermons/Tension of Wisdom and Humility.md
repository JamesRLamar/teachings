The tension between Matthew 10:16—_“Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves”_ (NKJV)—and Matthew 5:44—_“But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you”_ (NKJV)—reflects a profound ethical and spiritual challenge in the teachings of Yeshua (Jesus). This tension demands a nuanced understanding of the balance between discernment and compassion.

### Understanding the Tension:

- Shrewd as Serpents
    The term _phronimos_ in Greek conveys prudence, discernment, and strategic thinking. The serpent, in biblical symbolism, can represent craftiness (cf. Genesis 3:1), but Yeshua reclaims the positive aspect of this quality—wisdom in navigating a hostile world without being naive.
    
- Gentle as Doves
    The word _akeraios_ means pure, innocent, or unmixed. The dove symbolizes innocence and peace (cf. Genesis 8:8–12, the dove with Noah). Yeshua calls for moral integrity and non-violence.
    
- Loving Enemies 
    The term _agapate_ (from _agape_) implies a love rooted in commitment, self-sacrifice, and benevolence rather than mere affection. It is a conscious choice to will the good of the other, even the adversary.

Part of the balance is found in speaking but only with the intention of someone else's benefit. Someone can be spiteful or abusive towards you, and you can address their behavior, but address it so that they find the path of life, not so that you find justice or retribution.

### Philippians 2:3 (NKJV)

> _"Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself."_

Humility is strength under control, not weakness under submission.
