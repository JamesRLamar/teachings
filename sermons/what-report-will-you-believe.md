**Deuteronomy 1:24-25**

And they departed and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. They also took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought back word to us, saying, "It is a good land which the Lord our God is giving us."

**Deuteronomy 1:26-27**

Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the Lord your God; and you complained in your tents, and said, "Because the Lord hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us."

Notice there was no doubt that God existed or that He was real. Nor did they deny any past miracle as being a coincidence. Although they knew about God they did not know God, otherwise they never would have thought that God hated them.

**Romans 1:18-19**

For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them.

**Romans 1:20**

For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,

**Romans 1:21**

because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.

**Romans 1:22-23**

Professing to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible manâ€”and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.

**Deuteronomy 1:28**

Where can we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our hearts, saying, "The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there."

Once they were are on the precipice of stepping into the God's fullest Promise, the people did not want to enter. They sent someone to tip their toes in the water and tell them what it was like. It's true that

ten out of twelve spies brought a bad report, but I think even if one bad report had been given, Israel would have latched onto the words they already believed. Because after all they had seen they still did not trust God.

**Deuteronomy 1:29**

Then I said to you, "Do not be terrified, or afraid of them. The Lord your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all He did for you in Egypt before your eyes, and in the wilderness where you saw how the Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his son..."

**Deuteronomy 3:22**
You must not fear them, for the Lord your God Himself fights for you.

This is really such a beautiful picture of a loving God and loving Father. Yet the beauty of this is spoiled by Israel's complete lack of trust despite all that God done for them.

**Deuteronomy 1:32**
Yet, for all that, you did not *believe* the Lord your God.

**Deuteronomy 1:34-36**

And the Lord heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and took an oath, saying, "Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land of which I swore to give to your fathers, except Caleb...he shall see it...because he *wholly* followed the Lord."

**What does it look like to partially follow the Lord?**

**Are we sometimes guilty of not trusting God even after He has fought for us many times?**

**We are regularly bombarded with bad reports and bad thoughts, but the question to ponder is "What report will you believe?"**

**How does believing a good report or bad report affect us?**
