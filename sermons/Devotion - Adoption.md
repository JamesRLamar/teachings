- We were married for a long time, wanted children, but we were childless
- Even though we didn’t have children and really wanted children we trusted that God was in control
- Many years later God gave us an opportunity to adopt a child from someone who couldn’t care for their child
- That child was Chloe and we went through a whole lot to bring her into our home
- We loved Chloe before she even knew us or we knew her
- Chloe was our child, because we adopted her into our family
- A few months later Nicole got pregnant and we had another child and now we have two!
- Those two girls are about the same age and will get to grow up with their best friend

**Main points**

- God has a purpose, even in our pain or denying us things we really desire
- God is in control
- God provides
- God perfects our path
