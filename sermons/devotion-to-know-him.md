**What marked the division of the Protestant Movement?**
By grace alone, through faith alone, by Christ alone

**James 2:9**

If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well; but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.

**James 2:10**

For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.

**James 2:14**

What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can such faith save him?

**James 2:17**
Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

**James 2:18**

But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.

**James 2:19**

You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble!

**James 2:24**
You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.

**What does it mean to be a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ?**

**Acts 2:42 GW**

The **disciples** were **devoted** to the teachings of the apostles, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.

Devotion is not found in saying "yes" it is found in wisely learning how to say "no"

Disciple means "taught one". Part of being a disciple means being a passionate and devoted learner.

Being devoted to learning and gathering is not all that defines a disciple. There must also be fruit.

**What is the evidence or fruit of being a disciple?**

**John 13:35**

By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another

**1 John 2:3**
Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.

**1 John 2:4**

He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

**1 John 2:5**

But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God s perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.

**1 John 2:6**
He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.

**Judas vs Peter**

**They both:**

- Were called disciples of Jesus
- Shared meals with Him
- Walked with Him
- Talked with Him
- Performed miracles with Him
- Healed the sick with Him
- Sinned against Him and wept

Only one knew Him. Only one repented and accepted forgiveness.

*The most spiritually dangerous place we can be is to hear His words, memorize His Words, gather with His people, and yet still not know Him.*

**Matthew 7:22**

Many will say to Me in that day, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?"

**Matthew 7:23**

And then I will declare to them, "I never **knew** you; depart from Me, you who practice **lawlessness**!"
