## Practicing the Way 

John Mark Comer’s "Practicing the Way" emphasizes a set of spiritual disciplines designed to foster a deeper relationship with God and cultivate a Christ-like character. Here are some of the key practices:

1. **Silence and Solitude**:
   - Purpose: To disconnect from the noise of the world and connect with God.
   - Practice: Setting aside time daily to be alone in a quiet place, focusing on prayer, meditation, and listening to God.

2. **Sabbath**:
   - Purpose: To rest and delight in God's creation, recognizing His provision and sovereignty.
   - Practice: Observing a weekly day of rest, free from work and stress, dedicated to worship, rest, and joyful activities.

3. **Simplicity**:
   - Purpose: To free oneself from materialism and focus on what truly matters.
   - Practice: Decluttering one's life, reducing possessions, and prioritizing time and energy on relationships and spiritual growth.

4. **Slowing**:
   - Purpose: To counter the hurriedness of modern life and become more present.
   - Practice: Intentionally reducing the pace of life by eliminating unnecessary tasks, driving slower, and adopting a more mindful approach to daily activities.

5. **Scripture**:
   - Purpose: To understand God's word and apply it to our life.
   - Practice: Regular reading, studying, and meditating on the Bible.

6. **Prayer**:
   - Purpose: To communicate with God, expressing adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication.
   - Practice: Establishing a regular prayer rhythm that is contemplative and relational.

7. **Fasting**:
   - Purpose: To develop spiritual discipline and reliance on God.
   - Practice: Abstaining from food or other activities for a set period, focusing instead on prayer and spiritual reflection.

8. **Community**:
   - Purpose: To live out the Christian faith in fellowship with others.
   - Practice: Participating in a church community and intentional relationships for mutual support, accountability, and growth.

9. **Hospitality**:
   - Purpose: To reflect God's love and generosity and create space to make disciples.
   - Practice: Opening one’s home and life to friends, neighbors, and strangers.

10. **Confession and Repentance**:
- Purpose: To heal from sin and shame.
- Practice: Regularly confessing sins to God and trusted individuals and making concrete steps towards repentance and renewal.

**Romans 12:1-2**
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you prove what is that good and well-pleasing and perfect desire of Elohim.

## The Practices of the World

1. **Constant Connection** instead of Silence and Solitude:
   - Purpose: To ensure you’re never alone with your thoughts and always available at the beck and call of digital devices.
   - Practice: Glued to your digital devices, endlessly doom scrolling.

2. **Workaholism** instead of Sabbath:
   - Purpose: To prove your worth by working yourself to death.
   - Practice: Skipping family time, forsaking God-time, making sure your boss is happy every time.

3. **Materialism** instead of Simplicity:
   - Purpose: To fill the void in your life with stuff.
   - Practice: Buying stuff, obsessing about appearance, to impress people you don’t know or even like.

4. **Busyness** instead of Slowing:
   - Purpose: To make sure every minute of your day is packed so full you barely remember your own name.
   - Practice: Rushing from one task to another, multitasking like a pro, and wearing your busyness like a badge of honor.

5. **Entertainment and News** instead of Scripture:
   - Purpose: To escape reality while "staying informed" and avoid any deep thinking or confrontation of the growing hole in your heart.
   - Practice: Binge TV shows, playing video games, constant exposure to anything electronic, nothing organic.

6. **Self-Reliance** instead of Prayer:
   - Purpose: To be the master of your own universe.
   - Practice: Handling everything on your own because asking for help or seeking divine guidance is for the weak.

7. **Indulgence** instead of Fasting:
   - Purpose: To satisfy every craving because self-control is oppressive.
   - Practice: Overeating, overspending, and overindulging.

8. **Isolation** instead of Community:
   - Purpose: To create enough distance from others that they can't see or won't say anything about your broken soul.
   - Practice: Valuing independence above all, avoiding communal responsibilities, and living life on your own terms without accountability.

9. **Convenient Community** instead of Hospitality:
   - Purpose: To create your own club where only those who think like you get in.
   - Practice: Surround yourself with like-minded people, and shut out anyone who challenges these practices.

10. **Conceal Sin** instead of Confession:
- Purpose: To maintain a flawless image and never admit you're wrong.
- Practice: Hiding your sins and struggles.

## The Heart of Our Shared Mission: Being Disciples and Making Disciples

Practicing the Way has been on my heart a lot. What does it mean to practice the Way or be a disciple? How can we grow closer to God and know for certain that our activity helps us to know Him and reflect His character? The practices are simple, and we all know them, but our perspective and commitment towards those practices need help. It is a helpful perspective to know that every time you "show up," which means you decide to pause to give thanks, worship, read scripture, or intentionally practice the Way, you ARE getting closer to God. You don't need to question if you're trying hard enough, praying hard enough, etc. Just keep showing up and trust that God is there to meet you.

You need to put your trust in the aggregate, not the immediate. I often tell my Jiu-Jitsu students this when they ask what they can do to improve. It's a good question to ask and is likely motivated by a desire to be better at the art and be more skilled, but it also misses one of the most important points of the art: to enjoy the practice of the art. While my direct answer is to keep showing up consistently, the other part of the answer is to learn to relax and enjoy the journey.

When we can enjoy the practice, we will gain more from it. And since showing up consistently is the hardest part, making it enjoyable makes the hardest part the easiest.

In practicing the Way, you should not be concerned with the intensity of your effort but with the consistency and joy of each practice. Rather than be concerned with praying or reading scripture for one hour, be glad and first find fulfillment in doing so for one minute. If you can't find joy in one minute, you certainly won't in one hour; you won't make it an hour.

Instead of worrying about intensity, you should add better focus, intention, and enjoyment to each practice. Refuse to let the practice become dreaded. Besides consistency, the second hardest part of practicing the Way is renewing your joy in the journey. Sometimes, this will require you to relax when you want to press harder; it may require you to change the location or swap the practice with an entirely different one for a while.

Simplicity is often the key to finding joy in the practice. Remove from yourself grand expectations and instead lavish grace on yourself because of the struggle. And again, trust in the aggregate, not the immediate. You don't need to feel anything to know that practicing the Way leads to the Way.

## Reminders in Practicing the Way

**What Does It Mean to Practice the Way or Be a Disciple?**
- Question: How can we grow closer to God and ensure we reflect His character?
- Answer: Consistency and commitment to simple, known practices are key.

**The Power of Showing Up**
- You are getting closer to God every time you "show up"—whether through giving thanks, worshiping, reading scripture, or intentionally practicing the Way.
- Trust that God will meet you whenever you show up without questioning your effort.

**Trust in the Aggregate, Not the Immediate**
- Similar to learning a skill or art: Improvement comes from consistent practice and enjoyment of the journey, not from worrying about immediate results.
- Apply this principle to practicing the Way: Focus on consistent, joyful practice rather than intensity.

**Consistency Over Intensity**
- Embrace the joy of each practice, even for just one minute.
- Find fulfillment in small, consistent efforts rather than aiming for prolonged, intense sessions.

**Renewing Joy in the Journey**
- Make practices enjoyable to maintain consistency.
- Adapt when necessary: change locations, swap practices, or relax your efforts to keep the journey joyful.

**Simplicity and Grace**
- Simplify your practices and remove grand expectations.
- Lavish grace on yourself during struggles and trust in the cumulative effect of your efforts.
