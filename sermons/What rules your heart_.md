“And let the peace of Elohim rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one Body, and be filled with thanks. And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Master יהושע, giving thanks to Elohim the Father through Him.”

‭‭Qolasim (Colossians)‬ ‭3:15, 17‬ ‭TS2009‬‬

“Let the peace of God rule in your hearts.”

What rules your heart?

What wins the tug of war in your mind?

Does the lust of this world rule?

Does the worry of this life take top place?

What thoughts win the arguments in your mind?

Are you overcome by anxiety and fear? If so, then maybe it is not God’s peace that rules but your own thinking. Take this moment to stop the stinking thinking that should have no home in your heart. As the verse says twice above, “give thanks”. Only the wisdom and peace of God deserves to be on the throne of your life. Submit to Him. Resist the devil. Let the peace of Elohim and His kingdom reign over  every thought and emotion.
