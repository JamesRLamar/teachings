At the simplest level, symbols are just tools for communication. Letters are symbols. But symbols can be much more than innocuous or indifferent modes of communication. They can be used to elicit emotion and or proclaim allegiance which are much stronger concepts.

Symbols, like words can also change in meaning with time and across cultures.

**Examples:**
Cross or upside down cross
The word "fanny"
Pentagram
Swastika
The peace sign with the hand facing forward vs backwards

"Coca-Cola used it. Carlsberg used it on their beer bottles. The Boy Scouts adopted it and the Girls' Club of America called their magazine Swastika. They would even send out swastika badges to their young readers as a prize for selling copies of the magazine"

The earliest usage of the swastika is associated with Norse gods as a symbol of fertility carved onto "phallic objects". The other symbols used on conjunction with the swastika are the circle and the goat.

The oldest known symbol used in religious worship is the circle and the cross. It is called the solar cross.

Names are significant. The Hebrews forbid symbolic images. They believed in symbolic names and actions.

**Ezekiel 8**

**1 Peter 4:17**

**Revelation 22:4**
They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads

**Revelation 14**

Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father’s name written on their foreheads. 2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps. 3 They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. 4 These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from among men, being firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. 5 And in their mouth was found no deceit, for they are without fault before the throne of God.

6 Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people— 7 saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”

8 And another angel followed, saying, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”

**Exodus 13:16**
