During WWII, bombers we getting shot down regularly and the war was at risk unless the Allies could effectively control the skies. After each mission, a research team started recording the bullet holes and damage from each bomber. Every data point was painstakingly reviewed and recorded. The researchers poured over the data looking for vulnerabilities.

The data soon began to reveal that the wings and body of the plane is where most damage was received. Efforts began to start to reinforce these regions to give our p[ilots a better chance at surviving battle. But before those efforts could begin, a Jewish man named Abraham Wald pointed out a critical flaw in the analysis. The flaw was that the data only showed damage to those planes that actually returned from battle. In other words, the data actually showed where damage could be recieved and still allow the pilot to complete their mission and return home. This is now called Survivor Bias.

**Who are those that never return from battle? Who are those whose faith does not survive? Where are fatal wounds received that people just don't come back from?**

- It's not those who struggle, we all struggle. It's those who stubbornly refuse to sacrifice their selfish ambitions.
- It's not those who experience lonliness. It's those who refuse to embrace correction and confession. It's those who choose to walk alone.
- It's not those who feel fear or doubt. It's those who fear man more than they fear God. The fear of man suffocates trust in God. It's a cancer that cannot be ignored.
- It's not those who are distracted, we all get distracted. It's those who lack determination. It's those who fail to see that He can't be our Savior if He isn't our Lord.

**Who are the survivors? Who are those who despite being attacked and wounded, will stand on the Day of Judgment?**

- It's not just those who pray.
- It's not just those who worship on the Sabbath.
- It's not just those who read the Bible.
- It's not just those who give all their posessions to the poor.
- It's not just those who weep over their sin. There is a difference between worldly sorrow and godly sorrow. Survivors don't just weep, they repent. They cut off the hand. They cut out the eye. And they cast them away so as to never offend again.
- It's those who are hungry for Him more than anything else.
- It's those who want to know Him at any cost.
- It's those who embrace the seriousness of their sin and the gravity of His grace.
- It's those who recognize that this life is a battle and refuse to allow any pain to spoil His promise

**What are the critical areas we need to protect**

- Our Hunger for His Voice, fasting
- Our Passion for His Presence, be willing to be a fool for Him
- Our Thoughts from the expectation of evil, believe God at His Word
- Our Joy in Simplicity, let you relationship be enough without religious check boxes
- Our Heart from the love of this world
