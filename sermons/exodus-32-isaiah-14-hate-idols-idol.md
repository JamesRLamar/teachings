**Retell the story of of the Golden Calf - ****Exodus 32**

An idol is anything that has your affection and your attention

An idol is also an iDoll. It is some world object or occupation that we project our worth and identity on to. This can be our job, our hobby, possessions, or anything else that steals away our affection and attention.

Dreams that begin with “I” are dangerous.

** Isaiah 14:13-14**
For you have said in your heart:
I will ascend into heaven,
I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;
I will also sit on the mount of the congregation
On the farthest sides of the north;
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
I will be like the Most High.
