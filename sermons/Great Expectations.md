**Hebrews 11**

1 And belief is the substance of what is expected, the proof of what is not seen.

2 For by this the elders obtained witness.

3 By belief, we understand that the ages were prepared by the word of Elohim, so that what is seen was not made of what is visible.

Verse 1. Notice the imagery around what is seen and not seen. "Belief" or "faith," as it is often translated, means to trust. "Substance" refers to an unseen sub-structure or foundation. Trust, or what we trust in, reveals what our foundation is built on and built of. But it is what we **expect **that reveals what we actually trust in, beneath the surface. Our expectations are proof of what lies beneath the surface. It is the "proof of what is not seen".

Verse 2. By building a foundation on trust in God, the heroes of our faith "obtained witness". "Witness" means to have seen something. In other words, their trust in what is not seen allowed them access to see even more of what is unseen (God and His Kingdom).

Verse 3. And we, by trust in God, are able to see that the physical world around us must not have been made by what is seen, but by what is unseen. Trust in God gives us eyes to see the foundation of things, the unseen substructure, built by the hand of God.

And again, what is the evidence that we trust in what is unseen? It is our expectation. What do you expect today? Worry is the expectation of evil. Hope is the expectation of good. Which fills your mind the most? What do your expectations say about what you trust in?

Tying together the lessons of this past week about pleasing God alone, let us consider another verse from Hebrews 11.

**Hebrews 11:6**

But without belief it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to Elohim has to believe that **He is**, *and* that He is a rewarder of those who earnestly seek Him.

How do we please God? By trusting in Him as our sure foundation. In Hebrew, the word "belief", is the picture of the confidence someone has while standing on a foundation they know to be rock solid.

The word "impossible" means impotent or without power. We are powerless to please God if we do not trust Him.

The first appearance of the word "He is", which is bolded, means "to be". It is the meaning of His very name. In other words, we must trust God to be the Great I AM.

"Earnestly" means to crave or to seek carefully. We must earnestly seek Him and trust that He is our reward and our rewarder. Remember the Colossians verse from earlier this week?

**Colossians‬ ‭3:23-24‬**
And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and **not to men**...

The rest of that verse says, "knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ."

Test your expectations today to test the foundation of your life.

Do you expect good from Him?

Do you expect things to work out because of who **He is**?

Do you expect great reward from Him because you know you are earnestly seeking Him?
