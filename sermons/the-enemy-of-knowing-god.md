title: The Enemy of Knowing God
---



Last week, we talked about desperation and why the angels cry holy. One of my main points was that knowing God leads to wholehearted desperation for Him. That desperation empowers surrender to His perfect will.

**2 Corinthians 10:5**  
Casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.

**Romans 12:2**  
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

**Isaiah 26:3**  
You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You.

**Psalm 94:19**  
In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul.

**What can stop us from knowing God?**

ANTs - Automatic Negative Thoughts

1. Slow down enough to recognize your thoughts and emotions
2. Write down the ANT
3. Ask yourself if it's true. Then, ask if it's absolutely true.
4. Write down the opposing positive thought.
5. Ask yourself if it's true.

**Philippians 4:8**  
Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things.

Meditate - reckon, calculate, consider, think about, let one's mind dwell on


Dr. Daniel Amen also developed the "One-Page Miracle" (OPM) as a simple yet powerful tool to help individuals clarify their goals and align their daily actions with their long-term objectives. The OPM serves as a guide to make decisions that support one's overall well-being and happiness. Here’s a breakdown of Dr. Amen's strategy for creating a One-Page Miracle:

Relationships (family, friends, romantic)
Health (physical, mental, and emotional)
Personal Development (spiritual growth, hobbies, learning)
Work/Career
Financial Health

**Proverbs 19:18 TS2009**
Where there is no vision, the people are let loose, But blessed is he who guards the Torah.

**How to create a Daily Vision Reminder**

1. For each key area, write down clear and specific goals. 
2. Ask yourself accountability questions for each goal that will guide your daily actions toward these objectives.
3. Review daily.

Example:

**Relationships**:  
- Goal: Have a meaningful and fulfilling walk with God
- Questions: Have I spent quality time with Him today? Have I slowed down enough to hear His voice?
- Goal: Build a loving and supportive family environment.
- Questions: Have I spent quality time with my family today? Have I communicated my appreciation to my spouse?

**Health**:  
- Goal: Maintain a healthy body and mind.
- Questions: Is this food choice good for my brain and body? Did I exercise or do active recovery today?

**Work**:  
- Goal: Find joy in my work.
- Questions: Is my work taking away from my health or relationships?

**Financial Health**:  
- Goal: Be financially stable and prepared for the future.
- Questions: Is this purchase within my budget? Can I use this purchase to help me reach my goals?
