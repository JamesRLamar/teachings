Read Matthew‬ ‭18:1-5, 8-9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
https://www.bible.com/114/mat.18.1-5,8-9.nkjv

“At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” Then Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them, and said, “Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.

“If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire.”

**What does it mean to be like a child?**
Children are humble, trusting, innocent and full of faith

**What did Jesus mean by cutting off your hand or cutting out your eyes?**
We cannot live for earthly comfort and have heavenly comfort too.
