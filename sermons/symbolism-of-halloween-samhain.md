# Introduction

I always find it helpful and honest when approaching a controversial subject to examine those who oppose my present thinking. If I wanted to know the truth about evolution I would start by finding the most popular and compelling arguments for evolution, since my predisposition is that evolutions is false. This can be a bit scary, but if the pursuit is "real truth" there isn't a better way to start narrowing in on what truth is than by confronting our beliefs head on. This is Socratic, to follow the truth wherever it may lead. So below I examine the two tops sources referenced by the wikipedia entry for Halloween which claim to provide evidence that Halloween and Samhain have no meaningful connection.

# Examining the Critique of Connecting Halloween and Samhain - Part 1

According to authors of the book, **Treat or Trick? Halloween in a Globalising World**, there are two Cambridge scholars who merely "romanticised the notion of Samhain and exaggerated its influence on Halloween". - O’Donnell, Hugh; Foley, Malcolm (18 December 2008). **Treat or Trick? Halloween in a Globalising World**. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. pp. 91–92.

The excerpt noted above is referenced in the wiki page regarding Halloween as evidence that "Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day."

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween

The book was inspired by a conference held in Glasgow on Halloween in 2006. The intention of the conference was to gather modern academic treatment of the subject to try and settle disputes and disseminate comprehensive information regarding this holiday that has grown quite popular in the Western world in recent decades. This conference was attended by the authors, the future editor of the book, a few others guests in costume, and two very real Swedish witches. From this meeting came the inspiration of **Treat or Trick? Halloween in a Globalising World**.

The book cites three sources to support their argument, which include a book by Jack Santino called The Hallowed Eve. Here are some excerpts quoted in **Treat or Trick? Halloween in a Globalising World** from Jack Santino's work:

"The celebration of Halloween is thriving today in the United States, and growing internationally, although this latter fact is the cause of concern among many. The current orthodoxy is that the contemporary Halloween celebration is a Christianized version of Samhain, an ancient Celtic festival of the dead and the new year. Samhain is certainly a precursor to Halloween historically..." - pg 9

It's either ironic or negligent that the author's of **Treat or Trick? Halloween in a Globalising World** are cited as a source to support evidence that Halloween has no tangible connection to Samhain.

"Practitioners of neopagan and Wiccan religions confidently assert that they celebrate the ancient festival of Samhain as part of their religious heritage; many fundamentalist Christian groups denounce Halloween as diabolical." - pg 10

Regardless of whether the connection between Halloween and Samhain is resolute, the two holidays share near identical symbolism as well as being celebrated on the same day. Neopagans and Wiccans, no doubt, find it confusing for Christians to celebrate their highest holy day with the same customs and eagerness as they.

"Latin Americans observe November 1 and 2, All Saints and All Souls Days, as Days of the Dead, an occasion separate from but related to Halloween insofar as both are derived in part from the church's saint's days, both involve the merging of the church calendar with local folk tradition, and both involve the concept of death..." - pg 10

The mixing of calendars and customs is certainly one of the marks of the Catholic Church.

"There is no one "right way" to celebrate Halloween, but the holiday suggests inversion as a primary theme." - pg 10

Later the author describes what he means by "inversion" as saying Halloween is a day of opposites, when what is wrong is right. He describes the irony of transvestites dressing in full drag on Halloween since it is actually their true nature. The author points out that Halloween makes possible a day when transvestites can celebrate their perverted nature as normal.

"In addition, Halloween also is filled with images of death, primarily ghosts and skeletons. Perhaps this is an inheritance form the Celtic Samhain, during which festival the souls of the dead passed over from this world to the next...Whatever the case, Halloween combines these images seamlessly. Furthermore, images of evil and malevolence are also central to Halloween. Again, speculation suggests that this is due to the reinterpretation of the Celtic feast by Christianity-- as the church established November 1 as All Saints Day, the pre-Christian traditions and beliefs continued to be practiced on the folk and popular level." - pg 11

The "pre-Christian traditions" mentioned here refer to the traditions of Samhain despite the church's attempt to rebrand the day. Those traditions are still very much a part of the modern celebration of Halloween today, even in America where the holiday has been so commercialized.

"Thus the attention to the afterlife and many of the spiritual components of the old Samhain were seen as evil. Hell, Satan, and his dominions entered in the feast. Those said to have aligned with Satan, such as witches, and eventually any malevolent creature, from vampires to Freddie Krueger, became appropriate Halloween imagery." - pg 11

Here the author is pointing out that "old Samhain" customs were the influence for evil and demonic symbolism currently expressed on Halloween. They were not injected after the fact as part of the American commercialization, the malevolent elements of Halloween come from its roots in Samhain.

"Thus, Halloween is an occasion for the public display of images of death, dying, the macabre, and the occult. As elaborate as these displays and costumes can be, there is a sense of fun to it all." - pg 11

Here the author openly acknowledges the macabre nature of Halloween and its ties to the occult as "fun". Macabre means  disturbing and horrifying.

# Examining the Critique of Connecting Halloween and Samhain - Part 2

"Pope Boniface IV converted the Roman Pantheon into a Christian church dedicated to saints and martyrs during the 7th century. This day was then commemorated as All Saints’ Day."
