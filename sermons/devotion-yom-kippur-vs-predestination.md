**Yom Kippur - The Day of Atonement**

These days leading up to Yom Kippur are referred to as the Days of Awe, or the High Holy Days. Yom Kippur is considered the Highest Holy Day of the year. It is also called the Sabbath of Sabbaths. It is a time to afflict oneself and repent of all sin. It is believed that during this time the Book of Life is opened up and people are judged by their deeds having their name written or not written in the Book. It is held that on Yom Kippur the Book of Life is sealed and along with it, the fate of all humanity.

“And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: “Also the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the Day of Atonement. It shall be a holy convocation for you; you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. And you shall do no work on that same day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before the Lord your God. For any person who is not afflicted in soul on that same day shall be cut off from his people.”

‭‭Leviticus‬ ‭23:26-29‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

**Revelation 3:5**

He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.

**Imagine you are a butterfly, explaining to other butterflies or caterpillars how to become a butterfly**

For by ***Metamorphosis*** you have been ***Transformed*** through ***Surrendering*** your fat happy life of simply gorging yourself on food every day and dying to your old ways

![image.png](image-5.png)![image.png](image-6.png)![image.png](image-4.png)

True or False - Before a caterpillar is even born it is predestined to become a butterfly?

True or False - Before a caterpillar can become a butterfly it must choose to die in the cocoon?

True or False - Metamorphosis happens as a result of God's power and mind written in their DNA not because caterpillars are amazing engineers?

**Imagine you are a believer, explaining to other believers or non-believers how to become a believer**

For by ***Grace*** you have been ***Saved*** through ***Surrendering*** your life and dying to your old ways

**Ephesians 2:8**

For by ***grace*** you have been ***saved*** through ***faith***, and **that** not of yourselves; **it** is the gift of God

**Question, what is "that" and "it" referring to in the verse above?**

**Grace**
Greek definition: favor, gift, sweetness

Biblical definition - undeserved favor or sweetness shown via the good-will of another

**Luke 6:32-33**

But if you love those who love you, what ***credit*** is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what ***credit*** is that to you? For even sinners do the same.

**Where do Butterflies and Humans differ?**

1. Humans must choose to die to themselves
2. Humans must continue to choose to die to themselves

**How unnatural would it be for a butterfly to try to go back to it's life as a caterpillar?**

**Predestination**

Predestination and its sister doctrines come from John Calvin's theology summarized with the acronym T.U.L.I.P.

**Total Depravity** - All humanity is dead in trespasses and sins. Man is unable to save himself ([Genesis 6:5](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%206.5); [Jeremiah 17:9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Jer%2017.9); [Romans 3:10-18](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%203.10-18)). This tenant supposes that we are all born slaves to sin, but also supposes we remain slaves to sin even after we have been redeemed.

**Unconditional Election** - This is predicated on the first tenant, that we are *total* slaves to sin. Man is unable to initiate a response to God; therefore, in eternity past God elected certain people to salvation. Election and predestination are unconditional; they are not based on man’s response ([Romans 8:29-30](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%208.29-30);[9:11](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%209.11); [Ephesians 1:4-6](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%201.4-6), [11-12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%201.11-12)) because man is unable to respond, nor does he want to.

**Limited Atonement**- Because God determined that certain ones should be saved as a result of God’s unconditional election, He determined that Christ should die for the elect alone. Christ died only for those who were elected ([Matthew 1:21](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%201.21); [John 10:11](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2010.11); [17:9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2017.9); [Acts 20:28](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts%2020.28); [Romans 8:32](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%208.32); [Ephesians 5:25](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%205.25)).

**Irresistible Grace**- Those whom God elected He draws to Himself through irresistible grace. God removes free will and when He calls, man responds ([John 6:37](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%206.37), [44](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%206.44); [10:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2010.16)).

**Perseverance of the Saints** - Only God's elected will persevere in faith through the Holy Spirit. None whom God has elected will be lost; they are eternally secure ([John 10:27-29](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2010.27-29); [Romans 8:29-30](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%208.29-30); [Ephesians 1:3-14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%201.3-14)). This also contradicts the first tenant which suggests that we remain slaves to sin even after redemption.

**Responses to TULIP**

**Romans 11:19-23**

You will say then, “Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.” Well said. Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear. For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either. Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off. And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.

**Hebrews 6:4-6**

For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.

* * *

**What should our response be to this teaching?**

As Paul said in Romans 11, we need to consider the goodness AND severity of God. We must realize that God's grace must be accepted and embraced. He is chasing after us with His Goodness (Psalm 23). We must allow ourselves to be immersed.

**Psalm 46:10 NASB**
Stop striving and know that I am God

John Piper (Calvinist) says in response to Ephesians 2:8 regarding faith, "We don’t create it. We don’t create faith with our free will. If left to our free will, we will all choose the pleasures of the creation over the beauty of the Creator"
