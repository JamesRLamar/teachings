Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.

Have you ever heard the expression, “you are what you eat?” It means that if you eat healthy things you’ll have a healthy body.

Do you think that could be true about your soul as well?

In Jesus’s time, religious people liked to make up their own rules about what it did or did not mean to worship God. One of those rules was that you always had to wash your hands before eating. Now washing your hands is a good rule, but it’s not a God rule. We are not sinning because we forget to wash our hands before eating.

Matthew 15:10-20 NKJV

When He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, “Hear and understand: Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.”

Then His disciples came and said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”

Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated? But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.

For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sin, thefts, lying, blasphemies or speaking inappropriately as God’s people. These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.

Why would the Pharisees be upset that Jesus said this?

Because washing hands was one of their rules and Jesus was pointing out that their hearts were full of evil even if their hands were clean.

According to Jesus, where do all kinds of evil sinful things come from?

So even more than making sure we wash our hands we should be sure we let Jesus wash what?

What happens if our hearts are dirty?
