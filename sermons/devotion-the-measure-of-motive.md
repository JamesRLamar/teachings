title: Devotion The Measure of Motive
---


All that **matters most** breaks down into two simple objectives:

- to know Him
- to make Him known

These two things could also be compared to the first and second greatest Commandments:

- to love the Lord your God
- to love your neighbor as yourself

If we do nothing else well but these two things, we have done all things well.
Yet if we miss these two things, it matters not what else we have done.

**Why does it seem so hard to remain focused on these two things?**

**How do we honestly know where we are in the pursuit of knowing Him and making Him known?**

**
**
Motive is all.
There can be no sin without sinful motive.
There is both sin of omission and commission.

# **The Measure of Motive**

**James 4:17**
Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.

**Romans 14:23**
Whatever is not from faith is sin.

**Colossians 3:17**

And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.

**According to Scripture, what areas of our life need to be surrendered to the purpose of the Lord?**

**Colossians 3:22**

Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God.

**There are two opposing motives being contrasted in this verse. What are they?**

**Colossians 3:23**
And whatever you do, do it **heartily**, as to the Lord and not to men.

The word **heartily** means to do something from the inner most part of your soul outwards into all parts of life.

**What picture comes to mind when you visualize someone heartily doing all things as unto the Lord?**

**
**
**How does that picture differ from your day-to-day life?**
**
**
A way to measure motive is to ask **"Am I doing this as unto the Lord?"**

We need to ask ourselves, **"Is it direction or distraction? Is it good or is it God?"**
