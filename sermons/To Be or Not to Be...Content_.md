**1 Timothy 6:6**
Now godliness with contentment is great gain.

**What is contentment? What are the benefits of contentment?**

**Contentment - **a perfect condition of life in which no aid or support is needed

# 1 - Contentment is a choice

# 2 - Contentment is learned

**Philippians 4:11**

Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content

**How do we learn?**

We learn in two ways:

- Direct experience
- Indirect experience

The highest form of Wisdom is the ability to learn from other peoples mistakes.

**Proverbs 15:22**
Without counsel, plans go wrong, But by great counsellors they are established.

**Counsel** - trusted company

**Wrong** - break or frustrate

**Great** - multitude, greatness

**Counsellors** - those who can advise and offer guidance

**Established** - to be set on high, like a strong tower built as a monument for all to see

# 3 - Discontentment is learned as well

**How is your soul, at this very moment, at this very breath?**

**Who are your counselors?**
**

**Do you lack contentment? Do you have anything else you need to learn about being content?**
