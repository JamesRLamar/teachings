1 Corinthians 15:33
Do not be led astray, “Evil company corrupts good habits.”

The people we spend time with will significantly influence our values, attitudes, and behaviors. Even small seeds of doubt from unbelieving friends can have long-term effects on the integrity of our heart.

Choose friends who encourage your faith, not discourage it. This doesn’t mean we avoid unbelievers entirely, but it does mean we guard our hearts against prolonged exposure to toxic or unwise influences.

Psalm 1:1
Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers.

Notice the progression here: walks, stands, sits. Think about your own life.

• Who are you walking with every day? Are they leading you toward God or away from Him?

• Who stands with you in your faith journey? Are they encouraging your love for God, or are they indifferent—or even hostile—toward it?

• Who are you sitting with? Are your closest relationships rooted in godly values, or are they filled with negativity and cynicism?

Take a moment today to evaluate your circle. If someone in your life is dragging you down spiritually, it’s time to set some boundaries. Choose friends who lift you up, challenge you in your walk with God, and stand firm with you in your faith.
