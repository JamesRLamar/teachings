# Thoughts

Reminder of the Four Pillars of the New Testament Church
1. Apostles Teaching (Sound doctrine)
2. Loving Fellowship (centered around meals, Passover, and the Sabbath)
3. Prayer and Worship
4. Radical Generosity

**Hebrews 10:24-25**

And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.

**James 2:9**

If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well; but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.

**John 13:35**

By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another

**1 John 2:5**

But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God s perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.
