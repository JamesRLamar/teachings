Rev 1:8

"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," says the Lord, "who is and who was and who is to come,** the Almighty**."

Rev 4:8

The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying:

"Holy, holy, holy,
Lord **God Almighty**,
Who was and is and is to come!”

*Almighty*: “He who holds sway over all things”

Romans 15:13

Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

*Anxiety*: a need or want to control

*Worry*: mental distress or agitation resulting from concern usually for something impending or anticipated

Meditation:

Close your eyes

Breathe out and take a slow deep breath

Feel your heartbeat

Feel your breath gently rise and fall

Feel the ground underneath you

Sense the pull of the earth coming through your finger tips

Now look inwards…into your soul. The space of your mind, thoughts and emotions.

Observe what fills the space

Flashes of certain emotions or thoughts or worries

Don’t fight anything right now, just observe

How has your soul been these past few days?

What thoughts and feelings have filled this space?

Keep looking inside? Is there any anger in there?

Is there any fear?

Is there any worry?

If you can see worry inside your heart, raise your hand

Let’s focus on worry for a moment

In your mind, name all your worries. All of them. Even the ones you think aren’t worth naming

Name them once. Then name them again. Let’s get a clear picture of everything that has weighed us down

Breathe out and take a slow deep breath

Feel your heartbeat

Feel your breath gently rise and fall

Feel the ground underneath you

Sense the pull of the earth coming through your finger tips

Now sense the people around you

See if you can feel their presence

Feel the earth that is underneath you extend underneath them

Build an awareness of everything in this room

…

Now, remember who God is

He is El Shaddai, He who holds sway over all things

He controls your breath and heartbeat

He controls ever electrical signal in your body from your pinky toe running all the way up through spine and into the deepest parts of your brain

And He controls all over the same. Every person in this room breathes because He let’s it be so

Every pulse of the heart beats in a rhythm of 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, saying “thank you, thank you, thank you”

He controls the bond of every electron in your body, in the air, and in the earth

The flow of every electron spins about at His command

And now reach beyond these walls and feel all that is His across this whole earth

Every child, every person, every heartbeat

Every animal and living thing

Every tree, every mountain

The wind which sweeps over the whole earth and gently sways the oceans, lakes and streams

Feel the earth and all that is His, everything He controls

He holds sway over all things

And lastly feel yourself connected to this earth, this planet which is suspended inside an infinite cosmos

Every star, planet and galaxy in perfect balance and alignment

All things submitted to His every command

…

Breathe out and take a slow deep breath in

Feel your heartbeat inside your chest giving thanks to it’s Creator

Feel your breath gently rise and fall

Look inward once again…into your soul.

This is the only place in the whole universe God chooses NOT to control

Only you command your thoughts and from your thoughts come all your emotions

Here is the only place you can control

Here is the only place you must control

Outside of here is not your domain. It is His

Now remember those worries

One by one surrender those worries to the One who holds way over all things
