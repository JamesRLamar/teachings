---


**Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.**

**Have the children recall the first five commandments and the Two Greatest Commandments talked about from the week before.**

Exodus 18:21 NKJV

Moreover you shall select from all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

Exodus 18:21 ERV

But you should also choose some of the people to be judges and leaders. “Choose good men you can trust—men who respect God. Choose men who will not change their decisions for money. Make these men rulers over the people. There should be rulers over 1000 people, 100 people, 50 people, and even over ten people.

Exodus 20:17 NKJV

You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.

Luke 12:15 ERV

Then Jesus said to them, “Be careful and guard against all kinds of greed. People do not get life from the many things they own.”

Hebrews 13:5 ERV

Keep your lives free from the love of money. And be satisfied with what you have. God has said, “I will never leave you; I will never run away from you.”

Ephesians 5:3 ERV

But there must be no sexual sin among you. There must not be any kind of evil or selfishly wanting more and more, because such things are not right for God’s holy people.

Colossians 3:5 ERV

So put everything evil out of your life: sexual sin, doing anything immoral, letting sinful thoughts control you, and wanting things that are wrong. And don’t keep wanting more and more for yourself, which is the same as worshiping a false god.

**Ancient rabbi’s believe the Tenth Commandment was like a bookend of God’s Law. They believe coveting to be the opposite of loving God and loving your neighbor. ****Colossians 3:5 says that covetousness is idolatry. It means that the core of what it means to covet is to seek things that are not ours, especially the credit that God deserves. In other words, to covet is to seek to replace God who is the owner of all things.**

**Covetousness is desiring other people’s possessions or praise.**

**What’s wrong with desiring possessions?**

**What wrong with desiring praise?**

**Who ****owns all possessions?**

**Who deserves all praise?**
