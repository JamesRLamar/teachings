**Four Principles that Defy Naturalistic Evolution**
1. Life comes from Life
2. Matter cannot be created nor destroyed
3. Our world tends towards entropy and decay
4. The Design of DNA

# **1. Life comes from Life**

**John 14:6**

Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."

# **2. Matter cannot be created nor destroyed**

**Matthew 6:33**

But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.

**1 Corinthians 7:19**

Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters.

# **3. Our world tends towards entropy and decay**

**1 John 2:15**

Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

**1 John 2:16**

For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world.

**1 John 2:17**

And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.

# **4. The Design of DNA**

**Psalm 139:13-14**
For You formed my inward parts;
You **covered** me in my mother’s womb.
I will praise You, for I am fearfully and **wonderfully** made;
Marvelous are Your works,
And that my soul knows very well.

The word "covered" in this verse means to knit or weave.

The word "wonderfully" in this verse means to perfect, distinct, set apart, distinguished, and holy.

What happens if the DNA is corrupted? How is the body able to continue to live and thrive if its every cell is corrupt with bad instructions? What if you are born with a genetic disease?

Then the body must be completely remade. It must be reborn.

**John 3:1-2**

There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.”

**John 3:3**

Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

**John 3:4**

Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”

**2 Corinthians 5:17**

Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.

**Galatians 2:20**

I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.

# The Two Pillars of Salvation

**Death must occur for us to have life. Is there enough evidence to prove that the old you has died and Jesus has taken their place?**
