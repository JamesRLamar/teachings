title: Devotion The BE Attitudes Part 2
---


The word, "beatitude", refers to supreme blessedness. These are like the "Blessed Attitudes" and the way in which we ought to "be".

Recite beatitudes from memory.

What was the main theme of the beatitudes?

Meekness is not weakness
But being nice can be a vice

**Isaiah 53:7**
He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
Yet He opened not His mouth;
He was led as a lamb to the slaughter,
And as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
So He opened not His mouth.

**Luke 23:34**
Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.”

**Hebrews 12:3-6**

For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls. You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin.

And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons:
“My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,
Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;
For whom the Lord loves He chastens,
And scourges every son whom He receives.”

**Read Matthew 5:3-12**

**Read Psalm 37 and note the parallels between the beatitudes**

"But being nice can be a vice"

Sometimes people pleasers are the biggest liars. What do you think is meant by that?

Because people who are eager to please others often withhold the truth.

Being nice is not the same thing as being kind or loving.

I've heard a Catholic priest justify his rudeness as saying there is nowhere in the Bible it says we ought to be nice. And that's true, but kindness and gentleness are fruits of God's Spirit living within us.

**Ephesians 4:15**

but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ

**Deuteronomy 5:20**
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

"To bear" something is to allow it to persist or even to carry it around.

So how do we balance being meek with being honest and assertive?
