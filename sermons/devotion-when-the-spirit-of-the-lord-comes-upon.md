title: Devotion When the Spirit of the Lord Comes Upon

**Proverbs 29:18**

Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; But happy is he who keeps the law.

**Acts 2:1-4**

When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

**Joel 2**
17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God,
That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh;
Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
Your young men shall see visions,
Your old men shall dream dreams.
18 And on My menservants and on My maidservants
I will pour out My Spirit in those days;
And they shall prophesy.
19 I will show wonders in heaven above
And signs in the earth beneath:
Blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
20 The sun shall be turned into darkness,
And the moon into blood,
Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord.
21 And it shall come to pass
That whoever calls on the name of the Lord
Shall be saved.

I want us to see that Pentecost was unique but it was not a completely original experience.

**Numbers 11:17**

Then I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone.

**Numbers 11:25**

Then the Lord came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and placed the same upon the seventy elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they never did so again.

**Numbers 11:29**

Then Moses said to him, “Are you zealous for my sake? Oh, that all the Lord’s people were prophets and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!”

**1 Samuel 10:6**

Then the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man.

**1 Samuel 16:13**

Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah.

**Daniel 5:11-12**

There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God. And in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and King Nebuchadnezzar your father—your father the king—made him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers. Inasmuch as an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting dreams, solving riddles, and explaining enigmas were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, now let Daniel be called, and he will give the interpretation.

**Acts 19:6**

And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.

**1 Corinthians 12**

27 Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues.

29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? **But earnestly desire the best gifts.** And yet I show you a more excellent way.

**1 Corinthians 14:1**
Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.

**Do you eagerly desire the gift of prophecy? or any other gift?**

**How do we seek a gift anyway?**
1. Ask for it
2. Open it
3. Use it

**Ask for it**, this means what it says.

**Open it**, this means more about opening yourself up than the gift. Set your expectation on actually receiving the gift and then accepting the fear of the unknown and the consequence it may have on your reputation.

**Use it**, this means practically to speak, to proclaim, to do, to go, or whatever that gift may demand.
