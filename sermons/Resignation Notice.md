Here’s a thought experiment. Today, you need to turn in your resignation notice. It’s no longer your place to make discontent people happy. It’s time for you to move on and focus the rest of your life on pleasing the One True God.

Maybe your job or some other responsibility has weighed you down and has worn you down. Do you have a sense of peace or release when you think about resigning? I imagine there are many people who could use a good moment to fantasize about letting go and then realize that letting go is exactly what they should be doing in real life. Some of you know that feeling you have for the last two weeks after you quit, you’re invincible.

In middle school, I had a girlfriend named Jenny (I’m predicting that right now my wife is on Facebook stalking women named Jenny). Jenny was fickle. Every other week, Jenny would decide she liked another guy, also named James, more than she liked me. And every other week we would “break up” and two weeks later she’d be my girlfriend again because I was what she “really needed”. At some point, I realized I shouldn't care much at all about what Jenny thought or felt about me. She just wasn't worth the concern and it was painfully apparent she wouldn't be around forever.

Although Jenny’s phone appears to be the same. All the 80’s kids know what I’m talking about (867-5309).

Maybe your job, or whatever heavy burden you've been carrying, is like Jenny. It might be high time to let go and move on, at least in heart and mind. That worrisome thing won't be around forever, or likely even a long time. So why let it distract you from things that will last forever? Don't let it have another moment of your concern.

Now go enjoy the rest of your retirement while you still can. Don't let the invitation of our Messiah fall vainly on deaf ears. Answer the call to let go and let God.

Matthew 11:28-30

"Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”
