ShiT - Shield from Truth

- The thing that shields us from truth, not truth that shields us.
- It's like sunscreen that allows us to be in the truth while not actually being affected by it.
- When we sense that some fact will disturb our equilibrium, we shield ourselves from it.
- When we feel the truth might impact our tree of knowledge or unravel our worldview, we reject it in willful ignorance.
- It's just ShiT
- It's time to start calling ShiT out.
- We need to invite ShiT kickers into our life

- Illustration:
- Sitting on a toilet and pulling out a brown substance, and start rubbing it on my face. It’s time to knock this ShiT off.
