## 1. Desire is learned

**Psalm 37:4**
Delight yourself also in the Lord, And He shall give you the desires of your heart.

- Desire can be worldly or godly, but it's often the same Hebrew or Greek word used in both cases

**Psalm 27:4**
One thing I have desired of the Lord, that will I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord All the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple.

**Romans 7:7–8**
For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.” But sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all manner of evil desire.

## 2. Desire grows as you feed it

**Galatians 5:24**
And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

**Romans 13:14**
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.

## 3. Desire is a finite resource

**1 John‬ ‭2:15-17‬ ‭**
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.

- In that verse, the first two uses of "love" mean to cherish or prove one's love.

- The other use of the word "love," which refers to the "love of the Father," is agape, the divine love.

## 4. Desire comes from the heart

**Proverbs‬ ‭4:23‬**
Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life.
