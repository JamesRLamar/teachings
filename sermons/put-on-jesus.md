**Genesis 37:3**

Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age. Also he made him a robe of many colors.

**Romans 13:14**

But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.

"Put on" - to be clothed, to sink into a garment

**How would it feel to receive the robe that Jesus wore?**
**
**

**What if He gave you His robe and told you to go into the world wearing it and representing Him?**

**
**
**How would you act differently if you had on that robe?**
**
**
**How would *Jesus* feel if you wore His robe and:**

- **Stole or cheated?**
- **Lied?**
- **Yelled at someone or said something mean?**
- **Complained all the time?**
- **Worried about other people liking you besides Him?**
- **Played video gamesÂ  or watched T.V. all day instead of spending time with Him?**
