# Jesus Is Enough

> "Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content...I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." (Philippians 4:11-13)

Jesus is enough—even when He doesn't do what we want, when we want it.

## The Ultimate Superpower

Imagine you're granted only one wish. Just one. 

You could wish for all the money in the world—every dollar, every fortune, every treasure. But what happens when inflation strikes? When the market crashes? When you realize money can't buy health, or love, or peace of mind?

You could wish for all the power in the world—the ability to control nations, command armies, bend reality to your will. But what happens when that power isolates you? When you discover that those who bow to you don't actually love you? When you lie awake at night, paranoid about who might try to take it all away?

You could wish for all the pleasure in the world—every thrill, every comfort, every indulgence imaginable. But what happens when the high wears off? When you need more and more just to feel something? When you wake up empty despite having everything?

But what if you wished for something different?

What if you wished for **contentment**?

If you possess contentment, it would be as if you had all three. You'd have the satisfaction of wealth without needing more money. You'd have the security of power without grasping for control. You'd have the joy of pleasure without the slavery of addiction.

Contentment is the ultimate superpower. And the ancient Jews had a song about this—a song called "Dayenu," which means "it would have been enough."

**Question:** What would it look like if Jesus truly was enough for you—even when He doesn't do what you want, when you want it?

## Urgent and Not Important

Read the story of Lazarus in John 11.

### The Delay

**Teaching Point:** Mary and Martha did everything right: they asked Jesus, they believed in Jesus, and they waited for Jesus. But Jesus didn't come.

> "When He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was." (John 11:6, NKJV)

Can you imagine? Your brother is dying. You immediately call on Jesus. You send text messages, you call, you leave voicemails, and you don't hear a word from Him for two whole days!

This didn't happen because He didn't care. Not because He didn't love them. He delayed *because* He loved them.

**Question:** How do we often react when God delays in answering our prayers?

### The Tears

And then something stunning happens:

> "Jesus wept." (John 11:35, NKJV)

The shortest verse in the Bible. The deepest truth.

**Teaching Point:** Jesus doesn't minimize our pain—He weeps when we weep, even when He knows the outcome.

**Question:** Does it change how you view your current suffering to know that Jesus weeps with you in it?

### The Death

> "So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days." (John 11:17, NKJV)

Four days. In Jewish thought, after three days, it was believed that the soul had departed, and there was no hope of revival. Lazarus wasn't mostly dead. He was utterly, irreversibly, no-doubt-about-it dead.

And then comes one of the most gut-wrenching statements in all of Scripture:

> "Then Martha said to Jesus, 'Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.'" (John 11:21, NKJV)

Do you hear the pain in those words? "If You had been here..."

It's the cry of every person who's ever felt abandoned by God:
- "If You had been there when I got that diagnosis..."
- "If You had been there when I was abused..."
- "Lord, if You had been here, this wouldn't have happened."

**Question:** What is your "if You had been here" prayer—the thing you wished Jesus had prevented or fixed before it was too late?

## The Dayenu

Now, during Passover celebrations, Jewish families sing a song called "Dayenu." It's a song of gratitude that says, "If God had only done this one thing, it would have been enough... but He didn't stop there."

Listen to how it goes:

If He had brought us out of Egypt, and had not executed judgments upon them — Dayenu!

If He had executed judgments upon them, and not upon their idols — Dayenu!

If He had given us their wealth, and had not split the sea for us — Dayenu!

If He had split the sea for us, and had not taken us through it on dry land — Dayenu!

If He had supplied our needs in the wilderness for forty years, and had not fed us manna — Dayenu!

If He had fed us manna, and had not given us the Sabbath — Dayenu!

If He had given us the Sabbath, and had not brought us before Mount Sinai — Dayenu!

And so on...

Do you see what's happening here? With each verse, they're saying: "God, You've already done more than enough. Each blessing by itself would have been sufficient. But You kept going. You kept giving. You kept loving."

**Question:** If God had only done one thing for you in your entire life, what would be enough to cause you to worship Him forever?

## Learning Contentment

> "Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." (Philippians 4:11-13, NKJV)

**Teaching Point:** Contentment is not about positive thinking or self-empowerment—it's about learning to remain faithful while suffering greatly.

Look at the context. Paul wrote these words from a Roman prison. He was chained. Beaten. Hungry. Uncertain if he would live or die. 

When Paul says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me," he's not talking about winning a basketball game or getting a promotion. He's talking about enduring suffering. He's talking about remaining faithful when everything is taken from you. He's talking about singing praise in the darkness of a prison cell.

**Paul learned contentment.**

**Question:** How does trial teach us contentment?

## Jesus is Enough

If He had only come in the flesh, and had not lived among us — Dayenu!

If He had tabernacled among us, and had not taught us the way of life — Dayenu!

If He had taught us the way of life, and had not healed the sick — Dayenu!

If He had healed the sick, and had not died for our sins upon the cross — Dayenu!

If He had died for our sins upon the cross, and had not risen from the grave — Dayenu!

If He had risen from the grave, and had not sent us the Holy Spirit — Dayenu!

If He had sent us the Holy Spirit, and had not prepared a place for us in His Kingdom — Dayenu!

If He prepared a place for us in His Kingdom, but I were the poorest of the poor who saw His face only once in an age, it would be enough. Dayenu! Dayenu! Dayenu!

**Teaching Point:** Jesus didn't just give us **what** we needed—He gave us **who** we needed, Himself, and that is more than enough.

## Closing

Contentment is the ultimate superpower. And the pathway to contentment is not getting everything you want—it's learning that Jesus is enough, regardless of what He gives or withholds.

So today, wherever you are—
- In the waiting, sing Dayenu.
- In the weeping, sing Dayenu.
- In the wilderness, sing Dayenu.

Jesus is enough. He has always been enough. He will always be enough.

Dayenu.

**Question:** Does your heart sing "Dayenu"?
