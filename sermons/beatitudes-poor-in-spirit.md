Matthew 5: 3-10 The Beattitudes

What does Jesus mean by blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven?

1. The poor know they are in urgent need of redemption.

2. The poor not only know their dependence on God and on powerful people, but also their interdependence with one another.

3. The poor rest their security not on things but on people. (Our ultimate security is in Christ)

4. The poor have no exaggerated sense of their own importance, and no exaggerated need of privacy.

5. The poor expect little from competition and much from cooperation.
6. The poor can distinguish between necessities and luxuries.

7. The poor can wait, because they have acquired a kind of dogged patience born of acknowledged dependence .

8. The fears of the poor are more realistic and less exaggerated because they already know one can survive great suffering and want.

9. When the poor have the Gospel preached to them, it sounds like good news and not like a threat or a scolding.

10. The poor can respond to the call of the gospel with a certain abandonment and uncomplicated totality because they have so little to loose and are ready for anything.

Now this list is in the context of one authors' preceived advantages to being physically poor on this Earth instead of rich. I do not think that Jesus only favors poor people and that you cannot come to him if you are rich.

Still there is something to Jesus' statement that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. What was it that kept the rich young ruler from realizing the life that he was missing?

It is not wrong to be given much, and we really aren't in that much control of who gets much and who doesn't anyways. But what do we do with it? Are our jobs, possessions, hobbies, and interests in the way of experiencing a meaningful life with Christ?

If you replace "the poor" in the list above with yourself do you find that you're in urgent need of redemption, is your security in God, do you value community over competition, would you follow the call of the Gospel with a certain abandon?
