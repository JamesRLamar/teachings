title: Devotion Stones of Rememberance
---


Much of the turmoil of our life comes from two things:
1. Our need to control
2. Our habit of expecting evil

We need to transform our internal compass that defaults towards fear and worry.

There are stones to forget. Stones we simply throw back at the enemy like David and Goliath

And there are stones to remember. We build those things up as memorials set always before us so we do not forget to goodness of God.

**Psalm 105:5**

Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced.

**Psalm 103**

Let's take time to write down all the miracles and testimonies of God as stones of remembrance. As we meditate daily on these things we will transform our internal compass to point towards hope and not worry, faith and not fear.
