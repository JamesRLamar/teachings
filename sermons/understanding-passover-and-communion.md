title: Understanding Passover and Communion
---


**Why is understanding and keeping Passover important?**

1. We are commanded to remember the Messiah's death until He comes again (1 Corinthians 11)
2. Passover is the anniversary of His death
3. Passover is an everlasting ordinance that initiates God's Sacred Times for His people (Exodus 12 and 13)

Most in the Church do not keep Passover, but they do keep the "Lord's Supper" or "Communion." Let's compare the two.

## Comparison of Passover and Communion

**Passover** (Leviticus 26)

- Done in remembrance of God delivering Israel from slavery and death
- The main symbols are the blood of the lamb (remembered through wine) and unleavened bread
- Is forbidden for uncircumcised unbelievers
- Is an everlasting ordinance (Day of remembrance)
- There is judgment on those who profane the Day (Leviticus 26)

**Lord’s Supper/Communion** (1 Corinthians 11)

- Done in remembrance of Christ's suffering and sacrifice which freed us from the slavery of sin and consequence of death
- The main symbols are the blood of the lamb (remembered through wine) and unleavened bread
- Is forbidden for uncircumcised (of the heart) unbelievers
- Is an everlasting ordinance (Day of remembrance), until the Lord comes again, 1 Corinthians 11:26
- There is judgment on those who profane the Day, 1 Corinthians 11:27-30

**Exodus 12 TS2009**

1 Now Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, "This month shall be your beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: "On the tenth of this month every man shall take for himself a lamb, according to the house of his father, a lamb for a household…"

6 Now you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at twilight. And they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat it. Then they shall eat the flesh on that night; roasted in fire, with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it…

11 And thus you shall eat it: with a belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. So you shall eat it in haste. **It is the Passover of Yahweh.**

**Who does Passover belong to? The Jews or Yahweh?**

12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am Yahweh. Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.

14 And this day shall become to you a remembrance. And you shall celebrate it as a festival to Yahweh throughout your generations – celebrate it as a festival, an everlasting law.

**What kind of law was Passover established as?**

**Exodus 12:43-45,48-49**

43 And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover: No foreigner shall eat it. But every man’s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then he may eat it. A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat it.

48 And when a stranger dwells with you and wants to keep the Passover to the Lord , let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as a native of the land. For no uncircumcised person shall eat it. One law shall be for the native-born and for the stranger who dwells among you.

**Who can receive the Passover?**

**Exodus 13**

3 And Moses said to the people: "Remember this day in which you went out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out of this place."

9 It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the Lord's law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand the Lord has brought you out of Egypt. You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.

14 So it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, "What is ***this***?" that you shall say to him, ‘By strength of hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the Lord killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast.

**What was "this" in reference to in the verses above?**

15 Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all males that open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ It shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt.”

## The Lord's Supper A.K.A. Communion


**What was Passover foreshadowing?**

**John 1:29**
The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"

**Are Christians supposed to keep Passover and Unleavened Bread?**

**1 Corinthians 5:6-8**
Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.


**Where does the word Communion come from?**

**1 Corinthians 10:16-17**

The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the **communion** of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the **communion** of the body of Christ? For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread.

**Luke 22:19-20**

And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; do ***this*** in remembrance of Me." Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you." (emphasis added)

**What was "this" referring to in the verses above?**

**1 Corinthians 11:17-30**

17 Now in giving these instructions I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse. Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper. For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of others; and one is hungry and another is drunk. What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing?

23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, "Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do **this** in remembrance of Me." In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood. **This** do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” (emphasis added)

**What is "this" in reference to in the verses above?**


26 For as often as you eat **this** bread and drink **this** cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes. (emphasis added)

**What happens when we miss the meaning of Passover?**

27 Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep.

**What does it mean to receive Passover in an unworthy way?**

## Who should and should not receive Passover?

- Anyone who is committed to Yeshua and trusts in His sacrifice to forgive their sins and make them free from the power of sin.
- Children who have not yet demonstrated a clear understanding of the seriousness of sin or the gravity of His grace should not participate. It is as good to make a child wait to partake in Passover as it is to make them wait to get baptized. The parents must decide when their child is ready for both baptism and Passover.
- Baptism and Passover have the same prerequisites. This does not mean that a family member cannot enjoy the dinner meal, but they should not participate in receiving the blessed bread and cup at the end.
- Adult believers do not have to have been baptized yet to receive Passover but should be ready to be baptized.
