[Exodus 32:1,3-6,19-20,25-29,32-35](https://my.bible.com/bible/406/EXO.32.1,3-6,19-20,25-29,32-35)** ERV**

1 The people saw that a long time had passed and Moses had not come down from the mountain. So they gathered around Aaron. They said to him, “Look, Moses led us out of the land of Egypt, but we don’t know what has happened to him. So make us some gods to go before us and lead us.”

3 So the people collected all their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron. He took the gold from the people and used it to make an idol. Using a special tool, he shaped the gold into a statue of a calf. Then to the people said, “Israel, here are your gods! These are the gods that brought you out of the land of Egypt!” Aaron saw all these things, so he built an altar in front of the calf. Then Aaron made an announcement. He said, “Tomorrow will be a special festival to honor the Lord.”

6 The people woke up very early the next morning. They killed animals and offered them as burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. They sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up and had a wild party.

19 When Moses came near the camp, he saw the golden calf and the people dancing. He became very angry, and he threw the stone tablets on the ground. The stones broke into several pieces at the bottom of the mountain. Then Moses destroyed the calf that the people had made. He melted it in the fire. Then he ground the gold until it became dust and threw it into the water. Then he forced the Israelites to drink that water.

25 Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get out of control. They were being wild, and all their enemies could see them acting like fools. So Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Anyone who wants to follow the Lord should come to me.” Everyone from the tribe of Levi ran to Moses.

27 Then Moses said to them, “I will tell you what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Every man must get his sword and go from one end of the camp to the other. You men must kill those who are against the Lord, even if they are your brothers, friends, or neighbors.’” The people from the tribe of Levi obeyed Moses. That day about 3000 of the people died.

29 Then Moses said, “Take your role today as special servants of the Lord because you were willing to fight against even your own sons and brothers. You will receive a blessing for this.”

32 Now, forgive them of this sin. If you will not forgive them, then erase my name from your book.” But the Lord said to Moses, “The only people I erase from my book are those who sin against me.

34 So now, go down and lead the people where I tell you to go. My angel will go before you and lead you. When the time comes to punish those who sinned, they will be punished.” So the Lord caused a terrible sickness to come to the people. He did this because they told Aaron to make the golden calf.

**Important points to notice in this reading:**

- The people wanted a god that was like the rest of the nations. Something cool and shiny and popular. It was very common in that area at that time to worship calves.
- The people still called their golden god Yehovah and claimed it was the god who brought them out of Egypt. They told the same story, but worshipped the god they created.
- The nations around them, who were their enemies, saw their idol worship. The people made sure they were seen.
- Aaron declared a new holy day or festival to honor God, but what they did at that feast was have a drunken party and dance around the golden calf.
- Moses washed their mouth out with the golden remains of the idol.
- Moses begged God to forgive the people or else take away his eternal life, but God refused and reminded Moses that only those who sin against him have their eternal life taken away. The symbol is that of having our names written in the book of Life.
- Sickness came upon the people because of their false worship as a reminding punishment

[Leviticus 9:23-24](https://my.bible.com/bible/406/LEV.9.23-24)** ERV **

Moses and Aaron went into the Meeting Tent. They came out and blessed the people. Then the Glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. Fire came out from the Lord and burned the burnt offering and fat on the altar. When all the people saw this, they shouted with joy and then bowed to the ground to show their respect.

[Leviticus 10:1-3](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/LEV.10.1-3)** NKJV**

Then Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it, put incense on it, and offered profane fire before the Lord , which He had not commanded them. So fire went out from the Lord and devoured them, and they died before the Lord . And Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the Lord spoke, saying: ‘By those who come near Me I must be regarded as holy; And before all the people I must be glorified.’ So Aaron held his peace.

**Important points to notice in this reading:**

- God cares about how He is worshipped. He is holy and those who worship Him MUST be holy
- God’s fire consuming the sacrifice is a symbol of what God desires to do in our life. We are living sacrifices and God wants to consume us by His Holy Spirit.
- It is thought from later verses that Nadab and Abihu were also drunk when they did this.
