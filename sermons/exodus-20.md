**Have the children retell some of the story of Israel coming out of Egypt. Just help them highlight the main facts to refresh their memory. **

**Take turns reading Exodus 19:1-20 NKJV**

**Take turns reading Exodus 20:1-21 NKJV**

**Why couldn’t the people approach Mount Sinai before God spoke the Ten Commandments?**

God’s Presence was on the mountain and would have killed them before He made a covenant with them.

**Why didn’t the people want to go up the mountain after God invited them to?**

Because they were still afraid that God’s presence would kill them. They asked that Moses would speak to them.

**Does God’s invitation to know him personally still stand today?**

**What keeps us from being close to God?**

**Talk about what each commandment really means.**

**Challenge them to memorize and recite the Commandments by the end of the night.**
