The Feast of Pentecost is a Feast of Yahweh, once celebrated as a pilgrimage feast and with two types of bread intertwined. This was a symbol of Jews and Gentiles becoming one in the Spirit. The meaning of this Feast is still being fulfilled until the Great and Terrible Day of Yahweh comes.

**Acts 2:1-4**

When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

**Joel 2**
28 And it shall come to pass afterward
That I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh;
Your sons and your daughters shall **prophesy**,
Your old men shall dream **dreams**,
Your young men shall see **visions**.

29 And also on My menservants and on My maidservants
I will pour out My Spirit in those days.

30 And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:
Blood and fire and pillars of smoke.

31 The sun shall be turned into darkness,
And the moon into blood,
Before the coming of the great and awesome day of Yahweh.

32 And it shall come to pass
That whoever calls on the name of Yahweh
Shall be saved.
For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance,
As Yahweh has said,
Among the remnant whom the Lord calls.

**Proverbs 29:18**

Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; But happy is he who keeps the law.

**Daniel 5:11-12**

There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God. And in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and King Nebuchadnezzar your father—your father the king—made him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers. Inasmuch as an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting dreams, solving riddles, and explaining enigmas were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, now let Daniel be called, and he will give the interpretation.

**What should being baptized in God's Spirit look like?**

**Acts 19:1-6**

1 And it happened, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper regions, came to Ephesus. And finding some disciples he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” So they said to him, “We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.”

3 And he said to them, “Into what then were you baptized?” So they said, “Into John’s baptism.”

4 Then Paul said, “John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.”

5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

6 And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.

**Acts 21:8-14**

8 On the next day we who were Paul’s companions departed and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.

9 Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.

10 And as we stayed many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.

11 When he had come to us, he took Paul’s belt, bound his own hands and feet, and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit, ‘So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’ ”

12 Now when we heard these things, both we and those from that place pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem.

13 Then Paul answered, “What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”

14 So when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, “The will of the Lord be done.”

**1 Corinthians 12**

27 Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues.

29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? **But earnestly desire the best gifts.** And yet I show you a more excellent way.

**1 Corinthians 14:1**
Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.

**Do you eagerly desire the gift of prophecy? or any other gift?**

**How do we seek a gift anyway?**
1. Ask for it
2. Open it
3. Use it

**Ask for it**, this means what it says.

**Open it**, this means more about opening yourself up than the gift. Set your expectation on actually receiving the gift and then accepting the fear of the unknown and the consequence it may have on your reputation.

**Use it**, this means practically to speak, to proclaim, to do, to go, or whatever that gift may demand.
