**Struggles as a father :**

- Saying yes
    - Spending time with them when we actually can
    - Letting them learn from their mistakes
- Being quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry
- Being focused on the right things
    - Video games
    - Work
    - Obsessions
    - Perfection

My greatest potential is fulfilled in helping others to fulfill their greatest potential.

When teaching a room of 20 people, I look to say well done to every person.

- If they are not doing well I take the time to teach until they do then I say well done.
- One hour once a week is enough for me to influence a large group of adults.
- The problem comes when we feel overwhelmed by the task and don't plan anything at all.
- Then I get down on the floor and I wrestle with them, but here is where I focus on the hungry.
- There will be times our children go through funk and giving them their space is important.

**Struggles with the Father:**

- Believing He cares
- Believing He is tender
- Believing He is affectionate and wants to give good gifts
- Believing He is patient and kind

**Romans 8:15**

For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.”

**Galatians 4:6**

And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!”

**Matthew 7:11**

If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!

**Luke 11:13**

If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”

**Psalm 37:23-26 NKJV**
23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord,
And He delights in his way.
24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down;
For the Lord upholds him with His hand.

25 I have been young, and now am old;
Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,
Nor his descendants begging bread.
26 He is ever merciful, and **lends**;
And his descendants are blessed.

**TS2009**
The steps of a man are ordered by יהוה, And He delights in his way.
Though he falls, he is not cast down, For יהוה is supporting his hand.

I have been young, and now I am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Or his seed begging bread.

All day long he is showing favour and **lending**; And his seed is for a blessing.

The word "lend" means:

- to become united
- to be entwined as a warm embrace
- to be invested in as a husband to a wife who bears his children
- to give away wealth without expectation
