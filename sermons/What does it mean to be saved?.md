**What salvation is not:**
- Not a creed or denomination
- Not a sinner's prayer
- Not an acceptance of God's existence
- Not going to church
- Not being a good person

The Gospel began in the beginning

**Genesis 3:15**
And I will put enmity
Between you and the woman,
And between your seed and her Seed;
He shall bruise your head,
And you shall bruise His heel.

It is also what makes baptism a necessary rite of declaration to the forces of darkness. Those forces of sin and death are what we are born into. We are born into the family of Satan as a symbolic child of sin. When we are born again, we need to declare our adoption by the Father, and disown our former family.

Read highlights in 1 John

**Ephesians 2:8-9**
For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. 

**Ephesians 2:10**
For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.

**2 Timothy 1:6-7**
Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.

power - "often understood as manifesting influence over reality in a supernatural manner"

Is this true about you? Do you walk in righteousness? Do you hear and obey His Spirit? Are you a faithful ambassador of the Gospel? Can His Spirit do miracles through you as a sign to unbelievers?
