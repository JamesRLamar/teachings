Do you know what yesterday was? Not today

Do you know what will happen tomorrow? Neither do I and tomorrow isn’t even promised.

The only day you can change is ***today***.

Don’t waste time trying to control a day you can’t change at the expense of not controlling the one day you can, TODAY!

Carpe Diem. Seize Today!
