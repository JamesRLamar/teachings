## Why Have Holy Days?

Holy days or holidays, as we call them now, have been celebrated for thousands of years. They are symbolic days of remembrance for people and nations.

What does "holy" mean?

What are some foreign cultural holy days?

What are the American holy days?

>"Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘The **feasts** of the Lord, which you shall proclaim to be **holy convocations**, these are My **feasts**." (Leviticus 23:2)

**Holy convocations,** dress rehearsal
**Feast,** appointed time, appointed meeting, sacred season

Symbols of Yom Teruah:
- Day of the Awakening Blast
- Trumpet blast (shofar)
- The Great Noise
- The Last Trump
- The Hidden Day, which no one knows the hour
- Judgment Day
- 100 Repentance and Awakening trumpet blasts
- Inauguration of the Day of Atonement

**Teaching Point:**
Holidays are holy days, and they make us culturally distinct and serve to remind us of an important event.

**Question:**
What do you think the Day of Trumpet's dress rehearsal is for?

## 1. The Day of the Awakening Blast

> "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed— in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed." (1 Corinthians 15:51-52)

There's a moment in every great story when everything changes—when the sleeping hero awakens, when the hidden truth is revealed, when the long-awaited day finally arrives. The Feast of Trumpets, Yom Teruah—the Day of the Awakening Blast—points us to the greatest awakening of all time.

I had an alarming dream that stirred me late one night by the fireplace. I had fallen asleep on the couch. It was peaceful at first: the soft crackle of the wood, the slow rhythm of my breath, the warmth wrapped me like a blanket.

Then I dreamed I was still lying by the fire, but something was wrong.

The flames danced angrily.
The warmth turned violent.
Crackling became roaring.

Then—**BOOM**.

The room ignited like dynamite with me in it.

The noise awoke me so fiercely that I fell off the couch. My heart pounded like a chaotic drum. I was nauseous, trying to make sense of whether this was real or still a dream. I thought, “What does this mean?” I only knew that it felt final, catastrophic, and terrifyingly true.

**“Am I ready for Judgment Day?”** I couldn’t get the question out of my head.

The “last trumpet” heard on Judgment Day will not come as a welcome or a warning, but as a proclamation of what is. The time for repentance will have passed; only the Judge’s verdict will remain. And the fire will not come to refine, but to test. It is the end of the final exam, pencils are down, and time is up. The Book of Life will be sealed and bound; names written or unwritten, absolute. 

It is finished.

This is exactly what the Feast of Trumpets foreshadows—the moment when God's trumpet will sound across the earth, awakening every soul to the reality of His coming judgment and the beginning of His eternal kingdom.

**Question:** What would change in your life if you knew the trumpet of God would sound tomorrow?

## 2. The Hidden Day

**Matthew 24:36**
But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only.

**1 Thessalonians 5:1-3**
But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you. For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape.

**1 Thessalonians 5:4**
But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.

**Teaching Point:**
The Day of Trumpets is also called the Hidden Day, not because it is hidden from God's people, but because it comes like a thief to the rest of the world.

**Question:**
What happens when people think Judgment Day is completely hidden from them?
What does it look like to watch carefully for His return?

## 3. The Judgment Day

**1 Peter 3:10**
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. 

**Malachi 4:1**
For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze,” says the Lord of armies, “so that it will leave them neither root nor branches.

**Teaching Point:**
The same trumpet that awakens the righteous to eternal life will signal the destruction of the wicked in the fire of God's judgment.

**Question:**
What does the image of fire consuming chaff reveal about the finality of God's judgment?

## Closing

The Feast of Trumpets reminds us that God is just and His Judgment will come to the living and the dead.  We are called to be children of the Light who watch carefully for that Day.

- Are you living as if the trumpet could sound soon?
- What would need to change in your life to be truly ready for the awakening blast?
- What needs to be "awakened" in you?
