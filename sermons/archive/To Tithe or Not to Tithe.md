Tithing is a spiritual discipline of great power; able to bless us or curse us. But what if everything we know about tithing is **wrong**?!

## The FALSE Doctrine of Tithing

> The **FALSE** doctrine of tithing is a ***mandatory*** requirement to give a ***flat 10%*** of ***all*** your increase to the ***local*** church.

##### ***Who* is tithing demanded of?**

All believers, members, and regular attendees of a church.

##### ***What* is tithing?**

Tithing is an offering of 10% of our income or financial increase. "Increase" includes salary, gifts, windfalls—essentially all financial gain.

##### ***When* should we tithe?**

We are expected to tithe whenever we experience "increase", often citing Proverbs 3:9:

> *Proverbs 3:9* (NKJV):

> “Honor the LORD with your possessions, and with the firstfruits of all your increase.”

##### ***Where* should our tithes go?**

To the local church. Offerings above the tithe can go to any ministry or mission. Offerings are not mandatory.

##### ***Why* do we tithe?**

We are blessed if we tithe and cursed if we don't:

> *Malachi 3:8-11* (NKJV):

> "Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! ... Bring all the tithes into the storehouse... If I will not open for you the windows of heaven..."

##### ***How* do we calculate our tithe?**

Do we tithe on **net** or **gross**?

> *"Do you want a **net** blessing or a **gross** blessing?"*

Commonly cited Scriptures:

* Malachi 3:8-12

* Proverbs 3:9

* 1 Corinthians 16:1-2

* Matthew 23:23

* Hebrews 7:1-10

## The BIBLICAL Doctrine of Tithing

Modern teaching differs from the Bible. The Scriptures prescribe **multiple tithes**, totaling **23%-25%** of agricultural income, given by Israel to support the Levites, priests, and poor.

> The BIBLICAL doctrine includes ***mandatory*** contributions from the land of Israel totaling ***23%-25%*** of agricultural income.

##### ***Who* are the tithes and offerings demanded of?**

Members of Israel under the Abrahamic and Mosaic Covenant.

##### ***What* are the tithes and offerings and *when* are they given?**

**Three tithes** and **multiple offerings** from produce and livestock:

1. **First Tithe**: For the Levites

> *Leviticus 27:30,32* (NIV), *Numbers 18:24,28*

2. **Second Tithe**: Festival tithe, to be eaten in God’s presence

> *Deuteronomy 14:22–26*

3. **Third Tithe**: Welfare tithe, every 3rd year

> *Deuteronomy 14:28–29*

##### Important notes:

* Offerings are **mandatory** (except freewill offerings).

* Produce comes from **first 10%** (Prov. 3:9)

* Livestock from **last 10%** (Lev. 27:32)

##### ***Where* are the tithes and offerings brought to?**

To the **storehouse** (Levite cities), not the Temple.

> See *Deuteronomy 14:28*, *Malachi 3:10*

##### ***Why* do we give tithes and offerings?**

1. To trust God as Provider (*Deut. 14:23*)

2. To care for the poor and Levites (*Deut. 14:29*)

## Examining the Inconsistencies

The modern tithe doctrine is incompatible with Old Testament law.

### Do we have to give a flat 10% of *all* our increase?

No. Consider:

* Is a free lunch an increase?

* What if tithing on gross income makes us insolvent?

* Must we tithe on gifts (e.g. a car)?

* Is it ethical for church staff to be required to tithe back to their employer?

### Do tithes have to go *solely* to the local church?

There’s **no New Testament command** to do this. We are the Temple and the priesthood (*1 Corinthians 6:19*). Offerings in NT were **voluntary** aid, not tithes.

> *Galatians 2:10*: “They desired only that we should remember the poor...”

### Are we *required* to tithe?

Tithing is part of the Law of Moses.

> *Galatians 5:1-4, 6* warns:

> *"...if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing..."*

> *"Tithing is as much a part of the Old Covenant as sacrifice and circumcision."*

### What about other tithing references?

* *Matthew 23:23*: rebuke under Old Covenant

* *Luke 18:12*: religious Pharisee vs. humble tax collector

* *Hebrews 7*: Abraham’s one-time gift to Melchizedek (not a command)

## Honorable Mentions of Tithing

* *Malachi 3:8-12*: refers to **tithes and offerings**, i.e. **multiple**, not just 10%

* *Genesis 28*: Jacob’s **voluntary** pledge—not a requirement

---

## So what is the truth about ~~tithing~~ giving?

> *2 Corinthians 9:6-7* (NKJV):

> “...Let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.”

Paul gave **no instruction** to tithe—only to **give willingly and joyfully**.

---

## Conclusion

> My wife and I faithfully give a tenth of our income—not out of law, but love and generosity. Often, we give **more** than 10%.

We give to our local church, missionaries, and those in need. I want others to be **free** from the **yoke of bondage** and become **more generous**, not less.

Even giving **1% cheerfully** is better than 10% by compulsion.

### A Personal Story

A woman in my church worked 3 jobs and gave **nothing** out of guilt. I encouraged her to start small. She grew in joy and faith until she gave **11%**.

Like the widow’s mite, the **amount** doesn’t matter—only the heart behind it.

> *Proverbs 28:27* (NKJV):

> “He who gives to the poor will not lack, but he who hides his eyes will have many curses.”
