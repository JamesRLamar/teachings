**Genesis 6**

1 Now it came to pass, when mankind began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, that the fallen angels saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took them as their wives.

3 And the Lord said, “My Spirit will not put up with this behavior forever, I will limit the lifetime of a man to one hundred and twenty years.”

4 There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, These were the children of the fallen angels and the daughters of men. These were also the gods spoken of in ancient history.

5 Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every desire of his heart was only evil all day long.

6 And the Lord was sorry that He had made man, and He was greatly sad in His heart. So the Lord said, “I will destroy this creation whom I have created, both man and beast.”

8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. Noah was a good man, the most righteous of anyone who lived at that time. Noah walked with God.

11 The earth also was evil and broken, and filled with violence. And so God vowed to destroy the earth with a flood, but only the righteous would be saved through an ark that would carry His people through the water and flood.

After God flooded the earth, He caused a rainbow to appear in the sky for the first time. This rainbow was a reminder that God judges the wicked but saves the righteous. One day God will judge the earth again, but not by water. Instead next time God will judge the earth by fire. And again every wicked person will be destroyed and every righteous person will be saved.

What do we learn about who God is from this story?
