Did you wake up this morning thinking about the Enemy?

Well, he was up all night thinking about you. He wants to kill you in the worst way. Sound scary?

Well, God has been awake since before time and Creation and foresaw every battle and temptation the Enemy would ever devise. And thanks be to God, the Word says God will provide a way of escape for every struggle. 

That way of escape is found in seeking Him first and seeking Him often. So seek Him today because the war is real but so is the Promise.
