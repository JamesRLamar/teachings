Back when names used to have meaning, a name was very important. Today, our names rarely have meaning, but the labels we wear do.

**Name** - a distinctive designation to ones identity
**Label** - that which is affixed to ones identity

**Genesis 32**

22 And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok. He took them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had.

24 Then Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day.

25 Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him.

26 And He said, “Let Me go, for the day breaks.” But Jacob said, “I will not let You go unless You bless me!”

27 So He said to him, “What is your name?” He said, “Jacob.”

28 And He said, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed.”

29 Then Jacob asked, saying, “Tell me Your name, I pray.” And He said, “Why is it that you ask about My name?” And He blessed him there.

30 So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: “For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”

# **The Names of God**

**El Shaddai - God Almighty**
"The one who holds sway in all things"

**Yahweh or Yehovah  - I AM**
"to be the existing one"
"the one who was, who is, and who is to come"
"to become known"

**Yehovah Nissi - I AM your Banner**
Exodus 17:15

In battle opposing nations would fly their own flag on a pole at each of their respective front lines. This was to give their soldiers a feeling of hope and a focal point. This is what God is to us: a banner of encouragement to give us hope and a focal point.

**Yehovah Raah - I AM your Shepherd**
Psalm 23:1
**
**
**Yehovah Rapha - I AM your Healer**
Exodus 15:26

And He said, “If you diligently obey the voice of Yahweh your Elohim and do what is right in His eyes, and shall listen to His commands and shall guard all His laws, I shall bring on you none of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am Yahweh who heals you.”

**Yehovah Mekoddishkem - I AM your Holiness**
Exodus 31:13

Speak also to the children of Israel, saying: ‘Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you.

**Yehovah Jireh - I AM Enough**
Genesis 22

13 Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son.

14 And Aḇraham called the name of the place, ‘Yehovah Yireh,’ as it is said to this day, “On the mountain Yahweh provides.”

15 Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven, and said: “By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son— 17 blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies.

18 In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.”
