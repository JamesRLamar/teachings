## Problems with a Sunday Resurrection

1. The Roman perversion
2. The Bible doesn't say Yeshua rose on Sunday
3. The year Yeshua was crucified
4. The prophecy of Daniel's 70 weeks
5. The two distinct sabbaths
6. The sign of Jonah is three days and three nights

## Why is this important?

1. People miss the heart of God when they center their worship of Him and His story around sun worship
2. People use the tradition of a Sunday resurrection as justification for breaking the Sabbath Commandment
3. Yeshua only gave one sign to affirm Himself as the Son of God

### People miss the heart of God when they center their worship of Him and His story around sun worship

**Ezekiel 8:15–18**
15 Then He said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.” So He brought me into the inner court of the Lord’s house; and there, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun toward the east."

17 And He said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here?..." 

18 Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.

### People use the tradition of a Sunday resurrection as justification for breaking the Sabbath Commandment

**Matthew 15:3–9**

3 He answered and said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 
 
4 For God commanded, saying, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.’ But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God”— then he need not honor his father or mother.’ Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. 

7 Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:
"These people draw near to Me with their mouth,
And honor Me with their lips,
But their heart is far from Me.
And in vain they worship Me,
Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."

### Yeshua only gave one sign to affirm who He was

**Matthew 12:38–40**
38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.” But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

## The Roman perversion

We read last time about the stories of Polycarp and Polycrates and the concerted effort of the bishop of Rome to change the celebration of Passover. Those efforts were motivated for at least two different reasons. First, Romans hated Jews, and Passover was a Jewish holy day. Second, Roman political power and religious power went hand in hand. There were multiple campaigns throughout early Roman history to promote different sun-worshipping cults. Those cults were made state religions and thus tied to political influence.

### Why is this important?

Because Daniel and Revelation predict that the power which arise from Rome would seek to change times and laws and preach a perversion of the Gospel. Remember the Passover is part of God's story, His Good News, His Gospel. And we are ambassadors of that Gospel. Polycrates and Polycarp considered this a matter worth dying for and the bishops of Rome thought it was a matter worth killing for.

## The Bible doesn't say Yeshua rose on Sunday

**Luke 24:1–2**
Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared. But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

The only discrepancy with this account is Mark 16:9, but there are several reasons to believe that there is a missing comma or that this verse was added many years after Mark was originally written.

## The year Yeshua was crucified

There is an issue if Yeshua was crucified on Friday. If so, that means He died in 33 AD and had to have been born in 2 BC or 1 BC. 

Why is that a problem?

Herod the Great is the one who tried to have Yeshua killed as a child, but he died in 4 BC. In part, because of this fact, most historians believe Yeshua died in 30 AD and was born in 4 BC shortly before Herod died.

## The two distinct sabbaths

There are two different sabbaths mentioned between the death of Jesus and His resurrection. John says that the day Jesus was crucified was a preparation day but also says it was preparation for a high-day sabbath or annual sabbath, not a regular seventh-day sabbath.

**John 19:31**
Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.

There are two accounts of both Mary's getting spices for Yeshua's burial and resting on the Sabbath. 

**Mark 16:1**
Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary _the mother_ of James, and Salome bought spices, that they might come and anoint Him.

**Luke 23:56**
Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.

Both verses are correct, but you have to read between the lines to realize that the woman had to wait till the high-day sabbath day was over to buy spices since the shops would have been closed. So they bought the spices a full day after Jesus was crucified. But after buying those spices, Luke 23:56 says they rested on the Sabbath. So which is it? Well, it's both, since the Sabbath Jesus died on was an additional high-day sabbath. And the Sabbath after they bought the spices was a seventh-day sabbath. After they rested that seventh-day sabbath, they arose early the next day, Sunday, to go to Yeshua's tomb.

## The sign of Jonah is three days and three nights

Even if you say Yeshua was in the grave three parts of a day, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, you cannot argue that was in the grave three nights with that argument. If He wasn't in the grave for three days AND three nights, His sign as a prophet was false.

R.A. Torrey, a Yale University graduate, a colleague of D.L. Moody, and once superintendent of what would become the Moody Bible Institute, said this of the Passover chronology, "To sum it all up, Jesus died about sunset on Wednesday. Seventy-two hours later, exactly three days and three nights, at the beginning of the first day of the week (Saturday at sunset), He arose again from the grave. When the women visited the tomb just before dawn the next morning, they found the grave already empty. . ."

Torrey continued by saying, "There is absolutely nothing in favor of Friday crucifixion, but everything in the Scripture is perfectly harmonized by Wednesday crucifixion. It is remarkable how many prophetical and typical passages of the Old Testament are fulfilled and how many seeming discrepancies in the gospel narratives are straightened out when we once come to understand that Jesus died on Wednesday and not on Friday" (Difficulties in the Bible, 1907, 1964).
