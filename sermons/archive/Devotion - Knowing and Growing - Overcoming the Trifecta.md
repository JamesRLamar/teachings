1. Everyone is struggling with something. We may or my not KNOW

2. We need other people. We need to invite those people in. We need them to GROW

Possibly the most deadly enemy of our soul is a temptation trifecta of **Tired**, **Bored**, and **Alone**. None of us are immune to temptation. Even King David succumbed to a devastating Temptation Trifecta and forever tarnished his crown.

David’s story is recorded in 2 Samuel 11-12.

David was **Bored** and not walking in his God-given purpose as king.

“At the time when kings go out to battle...David remained at Jerusalem.” 2 Samuel 11:1 NKJV

David was **Tired**, because it was evening time.
"Then it happened one evening…" 2 Samuel 11:2 NKJV

David was **Alone** as he walked aimlessly on the roof of the palace.

"David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house.” 2 Samuel 11:2 NKJV

**Alone** does not always mean physically alone. It also means spiritually alone. It’s not just when there is nobody near you, but when there is nobody “with” you.

**Tired** is not just late-night or early morning. Tired comes when we have neglected the margin necessary to have health and balance in our life. There will be times we are unavoidably tired, but if we are casting all our care on Him then our hearts should be full of peace, not stress or despair.

**Bored** seems innocuous, but it is possibly the most deadly of the three. Bored is not a mere temporary emotion. It is a fixed state of mind and being. Bored happens when we are neglecting the divine purpose for which we have been called to and created. When we are not busy fulfilling our God-given purpose we are sure to find something less to fill our time and our mind.

In that Temptation Trifecta, David would commit the worst sins of his life. From that one moment of failure sprang a domino effect of sin and death, which included murder and adultery. To make matters worse, he lost his newborn son because of his extramarital affair.

David’s story is a heavy one. He dealt with tremendous guilt from his crimes. When confronted by the prophet, David exclaimed, "I have sinned against the Lord.” 2 Samuel 12:13 NKJV.

It would have been easy for David to let his grief and guilt consume him. The Bible records that David fasted and laid flat on his face until his son finally died. However, after his son passed away, David went to the house of the Lord and worshipped.

David’s servants were astonished at his behavior. They expected him to continue fasting and mourning, but David moved on. As hard as it is for us to accept, I think David did the right thing by moving on. He didn’t simply try to forget and fill his life with substitutes. David got back on track and filled life with the Presence of God once again.

Although the Scripture does not record it, I believe David understood what got him to that unhealthy place to begin with. And by worshipping, David was making sure he never went back.

Right now, you may feel great sorrow from some horrible failure or tragedy. The crushing guilt or pain may seem unbearable. I want to encourage you. Remember that even through the absolute worst time in David’s life:

God was not done with David and He isn’t done with you either!

After David’s son died he married Bathsheba, the woman with whom he had the affair. And from their union they gave birth to Solomon who would usher in an unparalleled era of peace for Israel. Solomon was chosen by God to build His Temple. And from the lineage of David and Bathsheba would come the Savior of the world, Jesus Christ.

Take courage! There are still chapters of your story still left unwritten…...
