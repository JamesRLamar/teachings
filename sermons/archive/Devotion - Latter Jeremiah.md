**Family focus:**

The consequence of sin.

“Make no mistake about this: You can never make a fool out of God. Whatever you plant is what you’ll harvest. 8 If you plant in ⌊the soil of⌋ your corrupt nature, you will harvest destruction. But if you plant in ⌊the soil of⌋ your spiritual nature, you will harvest everlasting life. 9 We can’t allow ourselves to get tired of living the right way. Certainly, each of us will receive ⌊everlasting life⌋ at the proper time, if we don’t give up.”

‭‭Galatians‬ ‭6:7-9‬ ‭GW

We deceive ourselves when we feed our sinful nature and expect there to be no consequences. God is not fooled.

What happens when we tell a small lie?

What happens when we commit a small sin?

When will it stop getting worse?

“Everyone is tempted by his own desires as they lure him away and trap him. Then desire becomes pregnant and gives birth to sin. When sin grows up, it gives birth to death. My dear brothers and sisters, don’t be fooled. Every good present and every perfect gift comes from above, from the Father who made the sun, moon, and stars. The Father doesn’t change like the shifting shadows produced by the sun and the moon.”

‭‭James‬ ‭1:14-17‬ ‭GW‬‬

Where does sin actually begin?

What is the end result of sin?

Why should we remember that everything that is good actually comes from God and not sin?
