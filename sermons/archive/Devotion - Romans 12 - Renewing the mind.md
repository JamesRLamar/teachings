**Romans 12:2**

And do not be conformed to this world, but be *transformed* by the *renewing* of your mind, that you may prove… the perfect will of God.

Draw a caterpillar, cocoon, and a butterfly. When the caterpillar turns into a butterfly it’s called metamorphosis. That’s the same thing God wants for us.

Under the caterpillar, write “OLD”
Under the butterfly, write “NEW"

**What thoughts and actions should we throw away?**

**What thoughts and actions should we encourage?**

**How do we learn what things should be old or new?**

First, we listen to our parents. Because our parents will teach us how to listen to God.

**Romans 12:2 TS2009**

And do not be conformed to this world, but be *transformed* by the *renewing* of your mind, so that you prove what is that good and well-pleasing and perfect desire of Elohim.

*Transformed*: transfigured; metamorphosis
*Renew*: renovate

When we renovate, nothing is too sacred not to be discarded.

**Titus 3:5**

not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and *renewing* of the Holy Spirit.

What is the Holy Spirit?
It is God. It is not a mystical force. God is Spirit.

So how can we be renovated by the Spirit of God?

It is only through quiet meditation that we can hear His voice and ponder His thoughts.

**Isaiah 26:3 NKJV**

You will keep him in perfect peace, Whose *mind* is stayed on You, Because he trusts in You.

**TS2009**
The one steadfast of *mind* You guard in perfect peace, for he trusts in You.

*Mind*: intent, foundation of our heart and thinking

**1 Chronicles 28:9**

As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind; for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands every *intent* of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.

*Peace*: shalom, the perfect protection and rest only God can assure
*Trust*: to rely on, to have confidence in

**Romans‬ ‭8:6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬**

For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

‭‭
What is the test of where your mind is?
Do you have life and peace?

The key is to learn to recognize the fruit of a mind that has strayed and renew it.
