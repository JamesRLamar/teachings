# The Law of God is a Salvation Issue

**Matthew 5:17-20**
17 Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 

18 For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. 

19 Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 

20 For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.

"The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees" refers to the fact that these religious leaders kept outward rules they made up in lieu of keeping the actual Commandments of God. Those rules were originally developed in order to protect the Ten Commandments, but eventually morphed into cultural norms that took precedent over the very thing they were meant to preserve. Ask yourself if such broken righteousness exists today. 

Can someone walk into a church and keep all the unwritten rules on the outside while living lawless on the inside? Let's be honest, there are elders, pastors, and priests in churches all over the world that will not inherit the kingdom of God no matter how much they tithe, teach, or wear their Sunday best. And how many of these same leaders teach others to do the same?

# The Law of God is Eternal

**Genesis 4:8-12**
Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him. Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" He said, "I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?" And He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground. So now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth."

**Genesis 26:4-5**  
And I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven; I will give to your descendants all these lands; and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed; because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.

Some say that the Ten Commandments are a part of the Mosaic Covenant, in the same way circumcision is. Thusly, some also say that unless a Commandment is explicitly repeated in the New Testament by Yeshua, then it is no longer relevant. Those laws that are not repeated in the New Testament are considered part of the "Old Covenant". I certainly agree that circumcision, along with most of the 600 plus additional laws in the Torah, are no longer moral obligations for God's people, but then again, they never were. Let me explain.

Many of the laws God gave to Moses were concerning ritual cleanliness and holiness as a people and nation. Most were not moral laws regarding issues of the heart and motive. Refraining from eating certain foods or touching certain things was a matter of holiness, not morality. But why the distinction? Because our Messiah had not yet shed His blood to permanently make atonement for both our sin and our uncleanness. 

The people of Israel walked with the Ark of the Covenant, which was a vessel of God's tangible glory and presence. To approach Him in a sinful or unclean state would mean instant death. Think about when Moses first approached God in the burning bush. Did Moses have to remove his sandals because it was sinful to wear shoes or because shoes in those days were covered in feces? God said to remove his shoes because the ground on which he stood was holy, therefore Moses needed to walk holy lest he perish.

Notice I also said that most of the additional laws in the Torah were not moral, but that doesn't mean all. In fact, the Council of Jerusalem, in Acts 15, was gathered to settle the matter of which of the laws of Moses were morally obligatory for Gentile Christians.

The first argument, that the Ten Commandments are part of the Mosaic Covenant or Old Covenant, is derived largely from the premise that the Ten Commandments did not exist until Moses and Mount Sinai. However, that argument  does not suffice to explain why Moses and the Hebrews observed the Sabbath before God spoke the Commandments from Mount Sinai.

**Exodus 16:4-5**
Then the Lord said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not. And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily."

**Exodus 16:22-30**
And so it was, on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. Then he said to them, “This is what the Lord has said: ‘Tomorrow is a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. Bake what you will bake today, and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.’ ” So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it. Then Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.” Now it happened that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none. And the Lord said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws? See! For the Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.” So the people rested on the seventh day.

Why would they be expected to observe the Sabbath before it was given as a Commandment on Mount Sinai? Because the Law of God was already written on their hearts and because the pattern and practice of the Sabbath had long since been established since Creation. There really isn't any other explanation to account for Exodus 16.

Again, the Sabbath has existed since Creation and the fourth Commandment reminds us of that fact. The keyword being, "reminds".

**Exodus 20:8-11**
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work…For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

In other words, the fourth Commandment is a reminder of what has already been established. The fourth Commandment and the Sabbath were not established on Mount Sinai; none of the Ten Commandments were. Before Sinai, Adam and Eve were held accountable for idolatry, among several sins, when eating from the Tree of Knowledge. Before Sinai, Cain was held accountable for murdering his brother. Before Sinai, Noah's son was held accountable for uncovering his father's nakedness. The list goes on.

The main point in rebuttal to the first argument is that the Law of God has always existed. And since it has always existed, it is eternal and timeless. It is also a reflection of the very quality and character of God. It's subtle for Western readers, but it's important to recognize that neither was the Sabbath unique or new among the Ten Commandments. You might even say all of time was christened with the Sabbath on the seventh day.

Cherrypicking out the fourth Commandment is not in line with the rest of Scripture, but the second argument mentioned earlier seems to indicate the fourth Commandment is uniquely obsolete. The second argument is that if Yeshua did not repeat a Commandment, then it is no longer relevant for Christians to uphold. People making that argument don't say that we shouldn't keep the Commandments, they say we should keep all the Commandments, that Yeshua explicitly mentions. Afterall, Yeshua said, "If you love me, keep my commandments."

So let's examine this argument from a few angles. First, there were a couple other Commandments Yeshua never mentioned explicitly and yet nobody claims we are permitted to bear false witness against our neighbor or steal or make idols.

Second, Yeshua did mention the Sabbath and the fourth Commandment, but He certainly never told us to break the fourth Commandment. In fact the bible is clear that keeping the Commandment "was his custom". Even on the day of Jesus' death, his disciples knew better than to do the regular work necessary to bury Him because the Sabbath had approached while He hung on the cross. So they had an emergency burial in Joseph's tomb.

Lastly, the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15) did not explicitly mention all Ten Commandments, in fact, it didn't mention any of them. Are we to believe none of the Ten Commandments are relevant to Gentile Christians because of that? Gentile Christians are obliged not only to keep the Ten Commandments but also to keep the laws of Moses concerning sexual immorality and idolatrous practices. Technically, means having sexual relations with another person's spouse. But there are indeed other forms of sexual immorality. The Council of Jerusalem is one surefire reason why things like beastiality and homosexuality are considered sinful.

The Council of Jerusalem is often referenced as a reason why we do not keep the Sabbath, when in fact the Council established the Sabbath Commandment along with all other nine Commandments.

# The Law of God is Distinct
![[DALL·E 2023-12-16 09.40.59 - A visual comparison between the Ten Commandments and the Law of Moses. On one side, stone tablets representing the Ten Commandments, with simple, clea.png]]

There are two kinds of laws spoken of in the Bible, but many people miss how these two laws are both different and distinct. There is the Law of God, and there is the law of Moses. But the word "law" can refer to either the Law of God, the law of Moses, the Pentateuch, or even the entirety of the Scriptures. So understanding which meaning the word "law" has requires careful study of the context in which the word is used.

This topic concerning the two distinct laws is not just a can of worms, it is many cans full of many worms. I expect you will have many "buts" to these points, but we must start the conversation somewhere. So please write down your questions and "buts" as you read.

Let's consider the use of the word "law" in the book of Galatians. Galatians is a particularly difficult book to discern regarding the word "law." Paul uses the word "law" 24 times in  Galatians, and only a couple of times does he give a hint of which law he is speaking about.

Galatians 3:17 is our first hint, "And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later..." Paul is talking about a law that did not exist until four hundred and thirty years after Abraham, which was the law of Moses. We must understand that the Law of God is written on all men's hearts from birth, since Creation. The Law of God did not suddenly appear on Mount Sinai. More on this later, but consider a couple of points, how would God have been justified in condemning Cain for murdering Abel, if murder was not explicitly understood to be wrong? Nowhere do we see God commanding Adam, or Cain, or Abel, "Do not murder," yet it is understood in the context of the story that what Cain did was very wrong.

Consider another piece of evidence to support the idea that the Law of God did not come four hundred and thirty years after Abraham. Genesis 26:4 talks about the promise that Abraham and his descendants would receive. The same promise Paul talks about in Galatians. Genesis 26:4 says, "And I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven; I will give to your descendants all these lands; and in your seed, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;"

Did you notice the semicolon at the end of Genesis 26:4? The next part of the sentence tells us why Abraham would receive this promise. Genesis 26:5 says, "Because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.” Did you notice the possessive word "My" before each of those nouns? These were God's Laws and Commandments Abraham kept. Nowhere do we read about a list of what those laws and commandments were, but it must have been explicitly understood by Abraham else how could he have kept them? And again, it is worth emphasizing why Abraham received God's promise...because he kept God's Law.

I often hear, "Cast out the bondwoman" in response to the concept that we must still guard the Ten Commandments, A.K.A., the Law of God. Some people claim we are to cast out the bondwoman as Paul says in Galatians 4:30, which they claim is the entire law, including the Ten Commandments. So in spite of the context mentioned in Galatians 3:17, people also ignore the context given six verses earlier in Galatians 4:24, "For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar." The context of the "bondwoman" is the law of Moses, not the Law of God.

Context is everything! Now we can read every mention of the word "law" before Galatians 4:30 as referring specifically to the law of Moses. Remember, the word "law" can be used interchangeably between referencing the law of Moses, the Law of God, or even both! We MUST know the context.

In the next chapter of Galatians, chapter 5, Paul continues the idea of the yolk of bondage being cast off, and what example does he give regarding that bondage? Circumcision. Circumcision is a sign of a fleshly covenant, and according to Paul, those who believe they must be circumcised are debtors to keep the whole law (again, the law of Moses). The new covenant is a covenant of the spirit for those circumcised of the heart, not the flesh. And what is the new covenant according to Jeremiah and repeated in Hebrews? Hebrews 8:10 says, "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."

The new covenant does not abolish the Law of God but rather establishes it. And did Jesus say anything less in Matthews 5:17? 

"Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill." -- Jesus

But even a sensible question can reveal what law God will write upon our hearts as part of His new covenant. Are we to believe that God writes upon the heart of every believer, "Do not eat shellfish," or is it more likely one of these laws, "Do not commit murder?" Is it not obvious when we ask simple questions that there must be a different kind of law distinct from the law of Moses that God holds sacred for all believers, Jew or Gentile?

**Galatians 3:28**
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

But let's step back even more when trying to interpret Galatians or any book. To be good stewards of the Word, we must look for the bookends or pillars of truth being established and recognize that the whole truth lay in the tension between those pillars, not resting on any one pillar alone. Case in point with Galatians, Paul is establishing a couple of different pillars of truth.

The first pillar, we are not slaves to the yolk of bondage, which in context is the law of Moses. There are indeed over six hundred laws in the law of Moses that ARE burdensome. Aptly Jesus proclaimed, "Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” (Matthew 11:28-30) Indeed, Paul is not saying anything new. He is merely commenting on what Jesus already taught. The fact that Paul is not saying anything new is very important because without recognizing that, we miss the original context, the very words of Jesus Himself.

The second pillar of truth Paul is establishing is in regards to righteous living versus unrighteous living and the very real consequence of both. Many know this pillar as the "fruit of the Spirit" versus the "works of the flesh." This is not only a bookend to Paul's letter, it is a very important bookend because even if we interpreted the first pillar as Paul saying we are no longer bound to the Ten Commandments, this second pillar negates any takeaways that we might also not be bound to the righteousness of those Commandments. We must consider the context of Paul's message with everything he says, even from other books he wrote.

**Galatians 5:13-14**
For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

**Galatians 5:19-21**
Now the works of the flesh are evident...of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

**Galatians 5:22-23**
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace...Against such there is no law.

Last but not least, my favorite, Paul, urges us to fulfill a "law"! But what kind of law? Who's law is this, you might ask.

**Galatians 6:2**
Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

It's almost as if Paul understands there are two sets of laws distinct from one another. One that came at Mount Sinai and one that came before the foundations of the earth.

Let me part with the same words Paul parted with, and let us consider this the bookend of the last bookend of Galatians. Let us consider what foolishness may come from those who ignorantly or selfishly read from Galatians and determine they are under no moral expectation in Christ.

**Galatians 6:7-8**
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.
