**The First Commandment**
**
**
**Exodus 20:2-3**

““I am the Lord your God. I am the one who freed you from the land of Egypt, where you were slaves. “**You must not worship any other gods except me.**”

‭‭Exodus‬ ‭20:2-3‬ ‭ERV‬‬

Who or what could be “other gods” that we must not worship?

**A warning from Moses**
**Deuteronomy 4:19-20**

“And be careful when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon, and the stars—all the many things in the sky. Be careful that you are not tempted to worship and serve them. The Lord your God lets the other people in the world do this. But the Lord brought you out of Egypt to make you his own special people. He saved you from Egypt. It was as if he pulled you from a hot furnace. And now you are his people.”

‭‭Deuteronomy‬ ‭4:19-20‬ ‭ERV‬‬

What is some proof today of the people of the world worshiping these things?

Why do you think people would ever worship the planets and the stars in the sky?

**Deuteronomy 12-29-31**

““You are going to take your land from other people. The Lord your God will destroy these people for you. You will force them out of that land, and then you will live there. But be careful that you don’t fall into the same trap they did! Don’t go to their false gods for help. Don’t say to yourself, ‘They worshiped these gods, so I will worship them too.’ Don’t do that to the Lord your God! These people do all kinds of bad things that the Lord hates. They even burn their children as sacrifices to their gods!”

‭‭Deuteronomy‬ ‭12:29-31‬ ‭ERV‬‬

Why do you think Moses was giving this warning considering what all the Israelites had seen Yahweh do for them?

**Joshua’s Appeal**
**Joshua 24:15**

““But maybe you don’t want to serve YAHWEH . You must choose for yourselves today. Today you must decide who you will serve. Will you serve the gods that your ancestors worshiped when they lived on the other side of the Euphrates River? Or will you serve the gods of the Amorites who lived in this land? You must choose for yourselves. But as for me and my family, we will serve YAHWEH.””

‭‭Joshua‬ ‭24:15‬ ‭ERV‬‬

Joshua, the leader of the Israelites after the death of Moses, had just reminded the people of all the great things Yahweh had done for them beginning with taking Abraham out of the land east of the Euphrates where they worshipped other gods. He spoke of their freedom from slavery in Egypt to their journey through the wilderness and their entrance and conquering of the promised land. He knew the temptation to worship other gods was real. It is a real choice for us today. Who are we going to serve? Who are we going to worship? What has Yahweh done in your life to remind you that He is worthy to be worshipped?
