Lamentations is a book which poetically describes the regrets and mistakes of a nation that was touched and chosen by God. They were given so much yet they squandered God’s love and their inheritance because they chose death over life. They were not driven by a sense of their eternal destiny but by their own selfish desires. We can learn from Lamentations by being honest with ourselves and asking the question:

What drives us?

Does Fear or Comfort drive us or are we loved every day to choose life and the discipline that it requires?

Most sinful living falls into one of those two feelings.

- Fear of man
- Fear of failure
- Worry
- Selfishness
- Discomfort
- Pain
- Pleasure

Why am I making this decision?
Why is my attitude such?

Attitude is not emotion it is perspective. But we can choose to let our emotions dictate our attitude.

“Those who live by the corrupt nature have the corrupt nature’s attitude. But those who live by the spiritual nature have the spiritual nature’s attitude. The corrupt nature’s attitude leads to death. But the spiritual nature’s attitude leads to life and peace.”
