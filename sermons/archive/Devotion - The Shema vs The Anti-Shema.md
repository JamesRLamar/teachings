Exodus 20 (ERV)

“I am the Lord your God. I am the one who freed you from the land of Egypt, where you were slaves.

“You must not worship any other gods except me.
“You must not make any idols.

“You must not use the name of the Lord your God to make empty promises. If you do, the Lord will not let you go unpunished.

“You must remember to keep the Sabbath a special day. You may work six days a week to do your job. But the seventh day is a day of rest in honor of the Lord your God. So on that day no one should work—not you, your sons and daughters, or your men and women slaves. Even your animals and the foreigners living in your cities must not work! That is because the Lord worked six days and made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything in them. And on the seventh day, he rested. In this way the Lord blessed the Sabbath—the day of rest. He made that a very special day.

“You must honor and respect your father and your mother. Do this so that you will have a full life in the land that the Lord your God gives you.

The first five commandments are a description of how we keep the Shema. Keeping the Shema is not so much about the big decisions but the accumulation of the small decisions we make every day. We must learn to develop a rhythm of spiritual devotion. Here are examples from Scripture that show what others did to demonstrate devotion.

Genesis 5:24
And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.

Genesis 24:63
And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening…

Leviticus 23:3

Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work on it; it is the Sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

Daniel 6:10 ERV

Daniel always prayed to God three times every day. Three times every day, he bowed down on his knees to pray and praise God. Even though Daniel heard about the new law, he still went to his house to pray. He went up to the upper room of his house and opened the windows that faced toward Jerusalem. Then Daniel bowed down on his knees and prayed just as he always had done.

Luke 4:16

So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.

Luke 5:16
So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.

What ways can we develop a daily spiritual rhythm?

What boundaries can we put around the Sabbath to keep it holy?

The Sabbath is a relationship transaction. The currency of all relationships is quality time.

What ways might our faith be challenged when the Anti-Shema is put in place?
