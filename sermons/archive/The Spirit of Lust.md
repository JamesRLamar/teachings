**Matthew 16:26**
For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?

**1 John‬ ‭2:15-17‬ ‭**
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.

> Imagine how a desire to do well at work could become a lust for accomplishment. 
> 
> Imagine how enjoying comfort could lead to a lifestyle of laziness. 
> 
> Imagine how a craving for acceptance could mutate into a yearning for popularity. 

**James‬ ‭1:14-17‬ ‬‬**
But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death. Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.

**Matthew 6:19-21**
Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

‭‭**Matthew 6:24-25**
No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life...

Where is your treasure?

What do we rely on to feel good? 

Are we infatuated with some external comfort that helps distract us from unresolved issues inside? 

Do we have a "feed" that helps to mask our boredom?

What things must I let suffer so that I can serve one Master?
