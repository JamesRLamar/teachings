Why is understanding this day and the other holy days important?

Because without understanding we will misinterpret Scripture and potentially be unprepared for the Day of Judgment.

**Colossians 2:16-17**
So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.

Holy convocations: dress rehearsal
Feast: appointed time, appointed meeting, sacred season

**Joel 2:1** (The Trumpet as a Warning of the Day of the Lord):

- A prophetic warning about the Day of the Lord, associated with the blowing of the shofar:
    
    > "Blow the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord is coming, for it is at hand."


**1 Corinthians 15:51-52**
Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed— in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

**1 Thessalonians 4:16–17**
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.

**Malachi 4:1**
For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze,” says the Lord of armies, “so that it will leave them neither root nor branches.

**1 Peter 3:10**
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. 

**1 Thessalonians 5:1-3**
But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you. For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape.

**1 Thessalonians 5:4**
But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.

**Matthew 24:36**
But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only.
