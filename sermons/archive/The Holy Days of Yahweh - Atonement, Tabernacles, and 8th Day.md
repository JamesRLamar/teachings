## Yeshua as the Passover Lamb

**John 1:29** 
The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!

**1 Corinthians 5:7–8** 
7 Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us. 

8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

> Passover and the lamb represent freedom from sin, while Kippur and the goats represent forgiveness from sin.

## Yeshua as the High Priest and Sin Offering

**Hebrews 9:22** (The Scriptures)
And, according to the Torah, almost all is cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

**Hebrews 9:11–12** 
But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.

**Hebrews 9:24–26**
For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

## The Final Closing of the Book of Life

**Revelation 20:12–15**
12 And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. 

13 The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. 

14 Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. 

15 And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.

# Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)

- **Symbols**
    - Tents
    - The body (John 1)
- **Fulfillment**
    - God establishes His permanent presence on earth for all eternity upon the new heaven and new earth Revelation 21

**Zechariah 14:16–17** 

16 And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. 

17 And it shall be that whichever of the families of the earth do not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, on them there will be no rain.

**Revelation 21:1–3**
1 Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 

2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 

3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.

**2 Peter 3**

7 But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

8 But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.

10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

# The 8th Day (Shemini Atzeret)

    - Eternal relationship with Yahweh
- **Fulfillment**
    - Eternal relationship with Yahweh

**Leviticus 23:36** 
For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. On the eighth day, you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no customary work on it.

**Revelation 21:4–6**
4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 

5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.” 

6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts.

**Revelation 21:22–27** 
22 But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 

23 The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light. 

24 And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it. 

25 Its gates shall not be shut at all by day (there shall be no night there). 

26 And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. 

27 But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.
