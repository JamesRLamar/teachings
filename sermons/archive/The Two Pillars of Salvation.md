**Exodus 20:1-6**

And God spoke all these words, saying: “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. “You shall have no other gods before Me. “You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands,*** to those who love Me and keep My commandments***.

**Exodus 13:9**

And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand, and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth

**Deuteronomy 6:4-5**

Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.

**Deuteronomy 6:6-7**

And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.

**Deuteronomy 6:8-9**

You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

**Deuteronomy 11:18**

Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.

**Revelation 12:17 **

And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, ***who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ***.

**Revelation 14:1, 9 The Message**

I saw—it took my breath away!—the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, 144,000 standing there with him, his Name and the Name of his Father inscribed on their foreheads...A third Angel followed, shouting, warning, “If anyone worships the Beast and its image and takes the mark on forehead or hand, that person will drink the wine of God’s wrath…

**Revelation 14:12 **

Here is the patience of the saints; here are ***those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus***.

**Revelation 22:14-15 **

Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city. But outside are dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie.

**1 John 2:3-6 **

Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.

**James 2 TS2009**

14 My brothers, what use is it for anyone to say he has belief but does not have works? This belief is unable to save him.

15 And if a brother or sister is naked and in need of daily food, but one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” but you do not give them the bodily needs, what use is it? So also belief, if it does not have works, is in itself dead.

19 You believe that **Elohim is one**. You do well. The demons also believe – and shudder!

**Matthew 7:21-23 **

21 “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’

Here are the ways the Two Pillars of Salvation can manifest themselves:

- Faith *and* Works
- Trust *and* Obey
- Relationship *and* Righteousness

The first five commandments are summarized by the Greatest. The last five are summarized by "love your neighbor as yourself". The root of them all is love. These Ten Commandments tell us “how” we love and "if" we actually know **Love**. Because love is not a noun or a verb in the biblical sense. Love is a person. Do you know Him? If you know Him you will be transformed by Him to be like Him.
