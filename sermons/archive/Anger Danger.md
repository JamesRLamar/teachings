**Have you ever murdered anyone?**

**Have you ever been angry before?**

**What’s the difference between anger and murder?**

## What is the Danger in Anger?

**Matthew 5**

21 “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the final judgment.’

22 But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother shall also be in danger of the final judgment. And whoever says to his brother, "You Worthless Nobody!" shall be in danger of the punishment. But whoever says, "You dummy!" shall be in danger of hell fire.

**How does anger become so destructive?**

Anger can lead to hatred and bitterness, which ultimately skew our perspective towards others to see them as less than the image of God.

Anger, hatred, and bitterness rob us of the fullness of life God desires.

**How do we keep anger from becoming hate?**

**Ephesians 4**

26 “Be angry, and do not sin”: do not let the sun go down on your wrath, nor give place to the devil.

29 Don’t speak mean or inappropriate words, but only say things that are able to help others believe in themselves, that it may give grace to those who hear your words.

30 And do not grieve or make sad the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were marked for salvation when Judgment Day comes.

31 Let all bitterness, rage, hate, complaining, and evil speaking be put far away from you, and also being hurtful towards others.

32 And be kind to one another, tenderhearted and sweet, forgive each other, even as God in Christ forgave you.

## How Can I Practice Forgiveness?

### Fore-give Mercy

This is a play on words I use to remind myself of the true nature of forgiveness.

Forgiveness isn’t about deciding who is worthy. It’s about deciding **before any offense occurs** that we will walk in mercy.


## Key Takeaway

**“Anger left unchecked leads to destruction, but forgiveness leads to freedom.”**

Anger itself is not a sin, but if we hold onto it, it can grow into hatred, bitterness, and division. Jesus warns us that anger is more dangerous than we realize—it can poison our hearts and damage our relationships. But God calls us to a better way. When we choose forgiveness instead of holding onto offense, we reflect His mercy and walk in the freedom He desires for us.

**So the real question is: Will you let anger control you, or will you choose to fore-give mercy and walk in God’s love?**
