**This Week**

And I appeal to you, brothers, by the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah, that you all agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be knit together in the same mind and in the same opinion.

Qorintiyim Aleph (1 Corinthians) 1:10 TS2009

- What is the importance of us (the church) being of the same mind and spirit being, as Paul puts it here, knit together?
- How do we accomplish this in a world that is bent on dividing people?

But the natural man does not receive the matters of the Spirit of Elohim, for they are foolishness to him, and he is unable to know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he who is spiritual discerns indeed all matters , but he himself is discerned by no one. For “Who has known the mind of יהוה? Who shall instruct Him?” But we have the mind of Messiah.

Qorintiyim Aleph (1 Corinthians) 2:14‭-‬16 TS2009

- According to this verse we are unable to discern the things of God without His spirit.
- Have your thoughts reflected the things of God this week or have they been overly focused on worldly things?

So neither he who plants nor he who waters is any at all, but Elohim who gives the increase. And he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

Qorintiyim Aleph (1 Corinthians) 3:7‭-‬8 TS2009

- I just think this is a great reminder that ultimately it is Gods Spirit that brings people to Him and we are messengers of that Spirit. The work we do to disciple people and to bring Gods truth to people is very important as we will see in the next verses, but it is still up to each individual to accept Gods word. It is ultimately His Spirit that brings them close to Him. We should not boast about how great our church is or how great a particular ministry is. We should boast in how great God is because He is the one who calls us, and He is the one who gives our churches and ministries life and increase

According to the favour of Elohim which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But each one should look how he builds on it. For no one is able to lay any other foundation except that which is laid, which is יהושע Messiah. And if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each one’s work shall be revealed, for the day shall show it up, because it is revealed by fire. And the fire shall prove the work of each one, what sort it is. If anyone’s work remains, which he has built on, he shall receive a reward. If anyone’s work is burned, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, but so as through fire. Do you not know that you are a Dwelling Place of Elohim and that the Spirit of Elohim dwells in you? If anyone destroys the Dwelling Place of Elohim, Elohim shall destroy him. For the Dwelling Place of Elohim is set-apart, which you are.

Qorintiyim Aleph (1 Corinthians) 3:10‭-‬17 TS2009

- How important is our discipleship of others?
- What kind of results should we hope to see from our discipleship of someone?
- How do we as a church build up disciples who will endure the things the world will throw at them

You Yourself shall arise And have compassion on Tsiyon (Zion), For the time to favour her, The appointed time, has come. For Your servants have been pleased with her stones, And they favour her dust. And the nations shall fear the Name of יהוה, And all the sovereigns of the earth Your esteem, For יהוה shall build up Tsiyon, He shall appear in His esteem. He shall turn unto the prayer of the destitute, And He shall not despise their prayer. **This is written for a generation to come, So ****that a people to be created praise Yah(God).** For He looked down From the height of His set-apart place; From heaven יהוה viewed the earth, To hear the groaning of the prisoner, To release those appointed to death, To declare the Name of יהוה in Tsiyon(Zion), And His praise in Yerushalayim(Jerusalem), When peoples gather together, And reigns, to serve יהוה.

Tehillim (Psalms) 102:13-‬22 TS2009

Let all the ends of the earth Remember and turn to יהוה, And all clans of the nations Bow themselves before You. For the reign belongs to יהוה, And He is ruling over the nations. All the fat ones of the earth Shall eat and bow themselves; All who go down to the dust bow before Him, Even he who did not keep alive his own life**. A seed shall serve Him. It is declared of יהוה to the coming generation. They shall come and declare His righteousness To a people yet to be born, For He shall do it!**

Tehillim (Psalms) 22:27‭-‬31 TS2009

- What is the common theme that you see vetween these verses?
- Is there anything that can hinder the plans of God? Is there anything that can stop Him?
- How important is it for us to declare Gods righteousness to the generations below us?

**Last week**

Blessed is the man You discipline, O Yah(God), And instruct out of Your Torah, To give him rest from the days of evil, Until the pit is dug for the wrong. For יהוה does not leave His people, Nor does He forsake His inheritance. For right-ruling returns man to righteousness, And all the upright in heart follow it.

Tehillim (Psalms) 94:12‭-‬15 TS2009

- Do you see the purpose in God's discipline? Do you feel blessed to be corrected by Him?
- Sometimes it is really hard to see the good in things God allows to happen, but we need to keep in mind that He is working to produce spiritual fruit in us, and that doesn't always coincide with the things we think should happen in life. Its also good to remember that the spiritual fruit God wants to produce in us has an eternal value aimed at bringing us closer to Him for now and for eternity.

Note: I included a lot of additional reading with the verse below. I also wrote some questions at the end that you could tie to just the verse below if you want the questions without going through all the extra reading. I do recommend the additional reading if you do have time though.

Come, let us sing to יהוה! Let us raise a shout to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us come before His face with thanksgiving; Let us raise a shout to Him in song. For יהוה is a great Ěl, And a great Sovereign above all mighty ones. In whose hand are the depths of the earth; The mountain peaks are His also. His is the sea, for He made it; And His hands formed the dry land. Come, let us bow down and bend low, Let us kneel before יהוה our Maker. For He is our Elohim, And we are the people of His pasture, And the sheep of His hand. Today, if you would hear His voice: “Do not harden your hearts as in Meriḇah, And as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, When your fathers tried Me, Have proved Me, though they saw My work.” For forty years I was grieved with that generation, And said, ‘They are a people who go astray in their hearts, And they do not know My ways.’ As I swore in My wrath, ‘If they enter into My rest...’

Tehillim (Psalms) 95:1‭-‬11 TS2009

This Psalm is requoted in Hebrews 4

Therefore, since a promise remains of entering into His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. For indeed the Good News was brought to us as well as to them, but the word which they heard did not profit them, not having been mixed with belief in those who heard it. For we who have believed do enter into that rest, as He has said, **“As I swore in My wrath, if they shall enter into My rest...”** And yet His works have come into being from the foundation of the world. For somewhere He has said thus about the seventh day, “And Elohim rested on the seventh day from all His works,” and in this again, **“If they shall enter into My rest...”** Since then it remains for some to enter into it, and those who formerly received the Good News did not enter in because of disobedience, He again defines a certain day, **“Today,”** saying through Dawiḏ so much later, as it has been said, **“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”** For if Yehoshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that. So there remains a Sabbath-keeping for the people of Elohim. For the one, having entered into His rest, has himself also rested from his works, as Elohim rested from His own. Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.

Iḇ`rim (Hebrews) 4:1‭-‬11 TS2009

- These verses are harkening back to the stubbornness of the people of Israel after theyhadbeen brought out of Egypt and they are calling us to enter into what God has for us with open hearts instead of the hard heartedness that the Israelites showed.

“Do not harden your hearts as in Meriḇah, And as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, When your fathers tried Me, Have proved Me, though they saw My work.”

- This verse from Psalm 95 refers back to the story below from Exodus17

Therefore the people strove with Mosheh, and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Mosheh said to them, “Why do you strive with me? Why do you try יהוה?” And the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Mosheh, and said, “Why did you bring us out of Mitsrayim, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” Then Mosheh cried out to יהוה, saying, “What am I to do with this people? Yet a little and they shall stone me!” And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Pass over before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Yisra’ĕl. And take in your hand your rod with which you struck the river, and go. See, I am standing before you there on the rock in Ḥorĕḇ. And you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people shall drink. **And Mosheh did so before the eyes of the elders of Yisra’ĕl. And he called the name of the place Massah and Meriḇah, because of the ‘strife’ of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and because they ‘tried’ יהוה, saying, “Is יהוה in our midst or not?”**

Shemoth (Exodus) 17:2‭-‬7 TS2009

Ironically this story takes place right after this one in Exodus 16:

And he said to them, “This is what יהוה has said, ‘Tomorrow is a rest, a Sabbath set-apart to יהוה. That which you bake, bake; and that which you cook, cook. And lay up for yourselves all that is left over, to keep it until morning.’ ” And they laid it up till morning, as Mosheh commanded. And it did not stink, and no worm was in it. And Mosheh said, “Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to יהוה, today you do not find it in the field. Gather it six days, but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, there is none. And it came to be that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none. And יהוה said to Mosheh, “How long shall you refuse to guard My commands and My Torot? See, because יהוה has given you the Sabbath, therefore He is giving you bread for two days on the sixth day. Let each one stay in his place, do not let anyone go out of his place on the seventh day.

Shemoth (Exodus) 16:23‭-‬29 TS2009

- So in all these verses there is a theme of entering into God's rest through obeying His commandments. To put it another way God's commandments are there as the blueprint to living a life full of God's Spirit and peace; they are not just rules.
- It's also clearly shown here that God cares about His Sabbath day as one of His commands.We see in these verses much about the importance of keeping the day in both the old and new testament examples.

1. What does it look like to you when you enter into Gods rest? Can you tell the difference between when you are walking with Him and when you aren't?

2. How do you see the correspondence of following God's commandments with obtaining His peace in your life?
