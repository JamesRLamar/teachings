**Matthew 11:28-30**

Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.

Christianity is not subscribing to a set of theological ideas or practicing a set of ethical ideals. Being is a Christian is about following the Christ.

What about you? Is your yoke easy? Is your burden light?

If not, maybe you've been caught up in merely accepting facts about the Messiah instead of accepting his invitation and embracing his lifestyle.

The truth about the yoke of Jesus is that it's still a yoke. Yoke are made to do work with. And following Him will still be a burden, burden's are extra weight. The kicker that makes his yoke not so easy and his burden not so light is when we insist on keeping ahold of all the things in our life AND try to follow him.

The yoke was a symbol of religious obligation and ritual. The word yoke does refer to the yoke put on cattle or oxen to till the ground, but the word also means balance. And the word "easy" means kind.

**Matthew 11:28-30**

Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.

**Psalm 45:7**
You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;

Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your companions.
