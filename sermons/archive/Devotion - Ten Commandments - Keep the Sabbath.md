**Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.**

Have the children do a plank contest to see who can stay up the longest. You can reward the winner.

Why did you stop if you knew you could win a reward? Because we need rest
What happens when we don’t rest? We would eventually die

Did you know that we even need to dream and that without dreaming our bodies will eventually die?

When we rest our body heals itself from all the work we have done that day. That’s how we get stronger. During the day we work and tear our muscles down, that makes us weaker, but resting makes us stronger.

God gave us a special gift. A day of rest instead of more work. A day we are supposed to remember Him and spend time with Him. If we remember that day, God will reward us with physical and spiritual strength.

[Exodus 20:8-11](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/EXO.20.8-11)

'“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.'

**I’m so glad God has given us his gift of the Sabbath, but just like if our bodies, what happens if we don’t rest our soul? Does our soul need rest?**

**How can we make the Sabbath holy or different from other days?**

Exodus 16:2-5 https://my.bible.com/bible/114/EXO.16.2-5

'Then the whole congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. And the children of Israel said to them, “Oh, that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.” Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not. And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”’

Exodus 16:22-24,27-30 https://my.bible.com/bible/114/EXO.16.22-24,27-30

'And so it was, on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. Then he said to them, “This is what the Lord has said: ‘Tomorrow is a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord . Bake what you will bake today, and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.’ ” So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it. Now it happened that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none. And the Lord said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws? See! For the Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.” So the people rested on the seventh day.’
