Since Creation, the sun, moon, and stars we set for signs and seasons. The word "seasons" is the same word used to describe what are also called the Feasts. Now the Feasts weren't established until the first Passover. Since the First Passover a sort of calendar and countdown begun until we reach what is known as the End of Days or Last Days.


Exodus 13:9, "And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand, and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth"

Exodus 13:16, "So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and as phylacteries on your forehead."

Exodus 31:13, "Speak also to the children of Israel, saying: 'Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you..."

Exodus 31:17, "It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed."

Deu 6:8, "You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes."

Deu 11:18, "Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes."

Exo 12:14, "So this day shall be to you a memorial; and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD throughout your generations. You shall keep it as a feast by an everlasting ordinance."

Lev 23:24, "Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a sabbath-rest, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation."

The word "it” being referred to in those verses is speaking of the sabbaths of the Lord and the Ten Commandments. Together those were the essential commandments from God, which were meant to cause the people of Israel to be set apart from other nations. 

Leviticus 23:23-32

You Teruah inaugurates Yom Kippur

[Joshua 6:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%206:5&version=NKJV)

It shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, andwhen you hear the sound of the trumpet, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the wall of the city will fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.”

[1 Corinthians 15:52](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:52&version=NKJV)

in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

2 Peter 3:10-13
King James Version

10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,

12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?

13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

Once every 49 years, the last Trump is actually blown on Yom Kippur to announce the year of Jubilee. Jesus may have already fulfilled part Jubilee in Luke 4, but certainly not all of it. For it speaks of a simultaneous event which is a year of the Lord but a Day of Vengeance.

So we may look for the season of Yeshua’s return to fall, especially on a Jubilee year. The symbols of Jubilee seem to match what we know of eternal life as well. There shall be no sowing or reaping. Everyone shall be made free, and everyone shall be called back to their birth homes.
