How many of you have a favorite superhero?

Who's your favorite superhero?

How cool would it be to meet your superhero in real life?

What would you be willing to give to meet your favorite superhero in real life?

God is the coolest person in the universe! Nobody is more powerful, or awesome than He is.

I can't think of anyone I'd like to spend time with than Jesus. How cool would it be to go for a walk with Jesus and ask Him about what it felt like to rise from the dead or to see people's limbs grow back. Imagine Him telling the story about how he created all the animals in the earth. Why He gave fish scales and dogs fur? Or what was He thinking when he made a duck billed platypus?

I want to hear about how He formed the stars and filled the oceans.

More than anything I want to hear why He created me. I want to know what He sees in me of all people, why did He create me? What are His plans for me?

I want to know Him. But how do we know someone or find someone who is invisible?

**Jeremiah 29:13**
And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with *all your heart*.

How much of our heart does God want?

Our heart is our emotions, our thoughts, and our desires.

And in order to find the God who created all things including you, you just have to search for him with your whole heart. Give Him all your thoughts, all your feelings, and all your desires and you will meet the coolest person in the universe.

Now imagine you made a pie for Jesus because you wanted Him to know how much you love Him and how much you really want to meet Him. And you put your whole heart into this pie, not your physical heart, your soul.

Imagine as your making this pie with all the good ingredients coming from your heart that your brother or sister walks by and kicks you in the shin. And that makes you knock over a bottle of spice, and that makes you sneeze all over the bowl of ingredients. "Oh no!" you might think. It's taken you over an hour to make this pie so far and you don't want to start over, so instead you just stir it up really good.

Ok, so now the pie is baked and ready to be served to God. It looks delicious, you are so proud of it. You can wait to see God's reaction. And as you sit and wait, the most popular person in your school walks by with some other friends from school. And they look at you strange because you're just sitting there with this pie, so you decide to pretend like this pie was for them. You cut a few small pieces and give it the popular kid hoping they will like you.

As you're sitting there waiting, you remember your parents asked you to clean your room and you told them you did, but you didn't. Now you're worried they'll walk in your room and you'll get in trouble, so you ask your sibling if they will go clean your room for you and if they do you'll give them a slice of this super tasty pie. They agree and you slice off another small piece and give it away.

Now a couple hours have passed by and your getting sooooo hungry. You take a little bite of the pie, and then another, and then another. But after a while God never shows up. You never get to meet Him like you hoped. You are so sad, but remember what God said through the prophet Jeremiah:

**Jeremiah 29:13**
And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with *all your heart*.

If we want to know God we have to seek Him with how much of our heart?

When you baked the pie, you started by putting your whole heart into it. You started well.

But you give away a slice when you tell a joke that makes one person laugh and another person cry.

You give away a slice when exclude someone from playing with you because you don't like them or because they hurt your feelings and you want to hurt them back.

There are many things and many people we will be tempted to give a part of heart to, but if we want to know God, the most super and awesome of all people, then we must seek Him with our whole heart.
