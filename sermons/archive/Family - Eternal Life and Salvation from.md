**John 3:16**

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

Tell the story of almost Pershing

Remind the children of the Story of the crucifixion.

We all want to live forever; nobody wants to die.

The Bible says that if we break God's Law, we can't live forever.

All of us have broken God's Law. So that means we are all going to perish. We won't live forever. But that's not the end of the story.

**John 3:16**

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

I'm so thankful that God loves me so much that He was willing to die for me. And I'm glad to trust in his sacrifice for me so that I can live forever.

Have you told God that you are thankful for His sacrifice? Have you ever told Him that you believe in Him and want to be forgiven of your sin so you can live forever?

That's part of what it means to be a Christian. It also means you let God change your heart and change the way you act and think.

How much would it hurt God's heart if you said you loved Him and trusted Him and were thankful that you died for your sins but then kept sinning?

But maybe you've never told God you loved Him. Maybe you've never really asked God to forgive you of your sins.

Right now as we transition to sing some worship songs, you can take this time to tell God those things. You can also ask an adult or your parent to come pray with you.
