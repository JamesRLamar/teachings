Test the children to see if they can quote all Ten Commandments. Read them in the TS2009 which properly declares each commandment as a characteristic of our identity not just a list of do’s and don’ts. The Shema is not just a list of Commandments, it is an identity. It describes our relationship with God, who He is, and who we are. Notice how each Commandment when translated literally declares who we are, “You do not…”. When my children make mistakes, I don’t just scold them and say “don’t do that!”. I tell them, “My Maci is kind. My Maci doesn’t lie. My Maci tells the truth.” In this way, I am not just giving her a list of commands I am casting vision for who I believe she is meant to be.

[Exodus 20:2-17](https://my.bible.com/bible/316/EXO.20.2-17) TS2009 altered for clarity

2 I am יהוה your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

3 You have no other mighty ones...

4 You do not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of that which is in the heavens above...

5 You do not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, יהוה your God am a jealous God, punishing the sins of fathers who hate me on their children who also hate me to the third and fourth generations

6 but I show loving-kindness to a thousand generations of those who love Me and guard My commands.

7 You do not take the Name of יהוה your God in vain...
8 Remember the Sabbath day, to set it apart.

9 Six days you labour, and shall do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath of יהוה your God...

12 Respect your father and your mother, so that your life may be prolonged in the land which יהוה your God is giving you.

13 You do not murder.
14 You do not commit adultery.
15 You do not steal.
16 You do not bear false witness...
17 You do not covet...

Have signs to hang around the children’s necks that label them with some kind of negative quality. “Liar”, “Hater”, “Thief”, “Bad”, “Dirty" etc. Recall the stories from last week about Jacob lying and stealing from his brother Esau. Ask if anyone remembers what Jacob’s name meant.

Jacob’s name meant “Liar”. Can you imagine if your parents named you Liar? Or Thief? Or Murderer? How would that make you feel? We learned from the story in Genesis that Jacob lived up to his name, which means he eventually became the thing he was labeled, just like the labels around your neck.

Our sin labels us. Sometimes even our friends or family label us. When we wear labels we can feel trapped and lose hope that we could ever become better than our labels. And that is very sad. But there is Good News!

God wants to relabel us. He wants to give us new names and make us new people just like we will read about in the life of Jacob. (Continue having the children read the Scriptures below)

[Genesis 32:3, 6-8, 22-28](https://my.bible.com/bible/406/GEN.32.3,6-8,22-28) ERV

3 Jacob’s brother Esau was living in the area called Seir in the hill country of Edom. Jacob sent messengers to Esau.

6 The messengers came back to Jacob and said, “We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you. He has 400 men with him.” 7 Jacob was very frightened and worried. He divided the people who were with him and all the flocks, herds, and camels into two groups. 8 Jacob thought, “If Esau comes and destroys one group, the other group can run away and be saved.”

22 During the night, Jacob got up and began moving his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven sons across the Jabbok River at the crossing. 23 After he sent his family across the river, he sent across everything he had. 24 Jacob was left alone, and a man came and wrestled with him. The man fought with him until the sun came up. 25 When the man saw that he could not defeat Jacob, he touched Jacob’s leg and put it out of joint. 26 Then the man said to Jacob, “Let me go. The sun is coming up.” But Jacob said, “I will not let you go. You must bless me.” 27 And the man said to him, “What is your name?” And Jacob said, “My name is Jacob.” 28 Then the man said, “Your name will not be Jacob. Your name will now be Israel. I give you this name because you have fought with God and with men, and you have won.”

The man that Jacob wrestled with was actually God. And when God asked him his name, Jacob had to say, “My name is Liar”. What a sad moment that must have been. We don’t know how or why Jacob started wrestling with God, but that moment changed his life forever. Because after Jacob was humbled to have his hip broken and when he had to admit his label. But then God changed his name to Israel, which means “Champion of God”.

God didn’t want Jacob to live like a liar or cheat anymore. God wanted Jacob to be like Him and he wanted to relabel him.

(At this point, go around and tape the new labels over the children that say “Champion of God”. Have the parents help do this for their children).

(After the children have been relabeled)

Aren’t you glad God wants to relabel us and doesn’t want us to be sinful?

Do you know how God relabels us? (Answer: He sent his son to take all the sinful labels and bury them after he died on the cross, so whoever trusts in Him would be relabeled and made new)

What would happen if you continued to lie after God relabeled you? Why is that wrong?

Every morning we wake up, we choose which label to put on and which label to live by. Which label do you want to live by?

Recite the Shema again and emphasize who is being told to listen, “Israel!”
