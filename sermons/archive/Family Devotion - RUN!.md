We know God tells us to put on the armor of God so that we can fight, but did you know sometimes we need to RUN!

A man or woman of God is also identified by what they run from.

What kind of things do you think God would want us to run from?

1 Timothy 6:9-11

But people who want to get rich keep falling into temptation. They are trapped by many stupid and harmful desires which drown them in destruction and ruin. 10 Certainly, the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. Some people who have set their hearts on getting rich have wandered away from the Christian faith and have caused themselves a lot of grief. But you, man of God, must avoid these things. RUN!

1 Cor 10:14
Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry

2 Tim 2:22
Flee lusts which tempt young people. Pursue what has God’s approval.

The word **flee** comes from the Greek word from which we get the word “fugitive”

The man or woman of God is a fugitive running from being taken as a prisoner. They don’t want to go back to sin; they know the dangers of it. So the word flee means to run for your life and never stop running!

Should we be careful about what we watch or look at?

Should we guard what we listen to?

Should we guard who our best friends are?
