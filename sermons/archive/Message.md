Vision:

**The New Testament Church had 4 pillars of devotion according the Scriptures:**

1. Apostles Teaching (Sound doctrine)
    
2. Loving Fellowship (centered around meals, Passover, and the Sabbath)
    
3. Prayer and Worship
    
4. Radical generosity
    

  

**Principles to live by:**

1. Live your life unto Him
    
2. Lead your family well
    
3. Love your neighbors intentionally
    
4. Listen to your calling
    

  

**Begin with the End**

- Those who stand in the day of judgment are those who know Christ and keep His Commandments. [Revelation 12:17](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/REV.12.17), [14:12](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/REV.14.12), [22:14](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/REV.22.14), [Acts 5:32](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/ACT.5.32), [Matt 7:21-23](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.7.21-23)
    
- The truth of salvation is the tension between two principle pillars, a relationship with God and obedience that follows. This is the New Covenant. [Jeremiah 31:33](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/JER.31.33), [Hebrews 10:16](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/HEB.10.16), [Hebrews 8:10](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/HEB.8.10)
    
- This means we feel the depravity of our sin so that we might experience the gravity of His grace. However, we also no longer try to live rightly out of obligation, but out of love. We acknowledge God’s Law (The Ten Commandments) as being distinct from Moses’ law which has obligations only to that mentioned in the Council of Jerusalem Acts 15.
    

**Everyone is a Disciple**

- We cannot give away what we do not have. A disciple must bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
    
- Disciple means “taught one”. Being a good disciple means being a passionate and devoted learner.
    
- A disciple knows the Shepherd and their life reflects such, 1 John 2.
    

**Everyone Studies Scripture**

- Synchronized daily Bible reading allows believers to witness a beautiful harmony as each person shares their unique perspective in the context of a common theme. [Philippians 2:2](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/PHP.2.2), [Acts 2:42](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/ACT.2.42)
    
- Heresy struggles in an environment where everyone studies the Scriptures. [Acts 17:11](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/ACT.17.11)
    

**Everyone Exercises Their Gifts**

- It is essential to Church health that we identify, equip and encourage the spiritual gifts and roles.
    
- The only single person the Body is built around is Christ, not a man or woman.
    
- We recognize the spiritual gifts as gifts given by God to people. We recognize Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds, and Teachers as people God has given as gifts to the Body.
    

**Everyone Makes Disciples**

- All Disciples are involved in making other disciples.
    
- Making disciples begins when we invite others into our life, not a gathering. [1 These 2:8](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/1TH.2.8)
    
- Discipleship isn't simply inviting someone to a gathering anymore than being a disciple means you simply attend a gathering.
    
- Relationship is the vehicle through which discipleship occurs. This is done with a commitment to spiritual maturity, not just being friends. Think adoption, not baby sitting.
    
- Every disciple can commit to 5:3:1. To actively connect to 5 people, be close enough to challenge 3 of those people, and make a lifelong disciple of at least 1.
    
- The harvest is not your responsibility, only being faithful to plant and water.
    

**Simplicity in Gatherings**

- What you draw people with is what you have to keep them with.
    
- Simple things are easy to reproduce and are necessary for successful multiplication.
    
- We will not emphasize high-performance, professional gatherings because they are expensive and difficult to reproduce. [Acts 2:42](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/ACT.2.42)
    
- The biggest mistake we could make is to attempt to recreate the highly professional and polished services of a mega church in a living room.
    
- A simple gathering where everyone has a voice and everyone expresses their gifts will accomplish more than the finest performance.
    
- "Don’t be afraid to develop gatherings that will be dull if God doesn’t move.” -- Francis Chan.
    
- We focus on family devotion and group discussion. We want parents to disciple their family well. If we fail at everything else but succeed at that we have accomplished much.
    

**Multiplication and Maturity**

- All mature and healthy things multiply.
    
- We believe the church will grow organically as the gathering reaches 20-30 people and has at least 1 person who is ready to lead.
    
- We must make disciples that will replace us, not require us. As such, it is the shepherd's responsibility to give away responsibility to others in order to prepare them.
    

**Radical Generosity**

- We do not teach an unbiblical mandatory 10%, but instead we ought to give in a measure that is increasingly generous and cheerful, both of our time and possessions [2 Cor 9:6:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+9%3A6-7&version=NKJV)
    
- Monthly giving discussions to celebrate and coordinate giving lead on rotation by each family
    
- We must always test ourselves by honestly asking, “Where is our treasure?” [Matt 6:21](https://my.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.6.21)
    
- We will never spend money on advertising. This means we will not seek to build a brand or business. We seek only to build the Kingdom of God and promote His Name alone.
