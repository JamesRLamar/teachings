**‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭16:7‬ ‭ERV**

7 But the Lord said to Samuel, “Eliab is tall and handsome, but don’t judge by things like that. God doesn’t look at what people see. People judge by what is on the outside, but the Lord looks at the heart. Eliab is not the right man.”

**What do spiritual people look like?**

**Matthew 5:20-22 Paraphrase**

20 Jesus said, "You must be more righteous than the teachers of the law and the Pharisees to enter the Kingdom of God."

21 You know the Commandment “You do not murder". And you know that any person who commits murder will be judged. But I tell you, don’t even be angry with anyone. Anger can become hate. And if hate is in your heart it is just like you murdered. And if you hate you will be in danger of Hell.

**The desires of our heart mean more to God than what we look like on the outside**

**Luke 16:14-15 ERV**

The Pharisees were listening to all these things. They criticized Jesus because they all loved money *and power*. Jesus said to them, “You make yourselves look good in front of people. But God knows what is really in your hearts. What **people** think is important is *worth nothing* to God.

What **people** think is important is *worth nothing* to God.

**What is important to God?**

**What’s in your heart today?**

**Have you lied to get what you want or make someone like you?**

**Have you been hurtful or hateful towards anyone? Even if just in your heart and not out loud?**

If we sin, just like our parents, God wants us to confess what we’ve done wrong. Then He wants to make sure we understand how much our sin can hurt us and others so we don’t do it any more.

If we confess our sin, God promises to forgive us of our sin and then cleanse our hearts so we be like him from the inside out.
