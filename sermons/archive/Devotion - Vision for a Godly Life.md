**Proverbs 29:18**

Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; But happy is he who keeps the law.

***Revelation***: vision or sight

***Cast off restraint***: to perish, to lack control, to be naked and exposed

***Happy***: blessed

**Genesis 3:1-10**

1 Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”

2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ”

4 Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.

8 And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.

9 Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, “Where are you?”

10 So he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.”

**Genesis 5:24**
And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.

**Romans‬ ‭8:6‬ ‭**

For to be worldly minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

**What does it mean to be worldly minded?**

**1 John 2:15-17**

Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.

**Look again at Genesis 3:6 and ask what three things made the fruit so tempting.**

**Without vision for what it means to know God and walk with Him, we will perish!**
