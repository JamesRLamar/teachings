**Meditation**
I am not insignificant. I am a priority to Him.
So I will be quick to soak in His affection.
I am not a burden. I am a delight to God.
So I will delight myself in Him.
God is not distant. He is near to those who seek Him.
So I will draw near to Him with anticipation.
I am not on my own. God is for me. God is with me.
So I will be bold in all I do, I will do as unto Him, not unto them.

**Paraphrase of Psalm 23**
Yahweh is the Shepherd of my soul. He eagerly provides all I need.

He leads me to still places where I can hear His awesome voice.
When my life is frenetic, He makes me to lie down.

His Presence restores my soul.

He teaches me righteousness for His Nameâ€™s sake and transforms me to reflect His image.

Whatever test I face, I have not a moment of worry.
I do not fear difficulty,
because if Almighty God is for me I know nothing can be against me.
Even the chastening of my God brings me comfort.

He laughs at those who persecute me.
He sets a table of honor before me in the presence of my enemies.

HE HAS CHOSEN ME!!!
I am his anointed, and oh, does my cup overflow!

Surely, Goodness and Mercy shall rush after me.
Where can I run from His glory?!

His house is my house.

I shall be counted as his prince or princess for as long as His Kingdom shall reign.

Yahweh is my God.
He is the Good Shepherd and that my soul knows very well. Amen
