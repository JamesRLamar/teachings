Holy Convocation: a dress rehearsal
Feast: an appointed time, sign or season

Take turns reading highlighted verses:
Genesis 1:14

And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years…

When God made all the stars, sun and moon, he made them first to declare His appointed times.

Leviticus 23:2 NKJV

Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘The feasts of the Lord , which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, these are My feasts.’

Leviticus 23:3 NKJV

Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work on it; it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.

Leviticus 23:4 NKJV

These are the feasts of the Lord , holy convocations which you shall proclaim at their appointed times.
