**Theme:**
Stones of Remembrance

**Illustration:**

Have someone represent God. God splits the Red Sea. Have the children walk through the sea and show amazement. Have them exclaim, “God you can do anything!” “We will trust you always.”

Next have the children start complaining about how hungry they are and how they will die now and how much they wish they were back in Egypt. Meanwhile, God will stand in midst of them with bread trying to get their attention until they finally calm down enough to notice God has already provided for them.

Next have the children complain about being thirsty then rinse and repeat as God stands in their midst with a cup of water.

Next have the children complain as they see enemies in the Promised Land while God goes ahed and kills all the enemies. Meanwhile the children cry out, “God where are you?!"

**Main Point:**

The Rock May be invisible but He has always been with us. We should establish stones of remembrance so we are not quick to forgot all that God has done and all He has promised to do.

**Scriptures to read:**

# 1 Corinthians 10 (NKJV)

### Moreover, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware that all our fathers were under the cloud, all passed through the sea, 2 all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, 3 all ate the same spiritual food, 4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ. 5 But with most of them God was not well pleased, for *their bodies* were scattered in the wilderness.

6 Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted. 7 And do not become idolaters as *were* some of them. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.” 8 Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell; 9 nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents; 10 nor complain, as some of them also complained, and were destroyed by the destroyer. 11 Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.

12 Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. 13 No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God *is* faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear *it.*

# Joshua 4:1-7 (NKJV)

### And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying: 2 “Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from every tribe, 3 and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet stood firm. You shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you lodge tonight.’ ”

4 Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from every tribe; 5 and Joshua said to them: “Cross over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, 6 that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones *mean* to you?’ 7 Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.”

**Questions:**
What are some great things that God has done?
What are some promises God has made?

- If we keep the law and meditate on it we will prosper and live.
- If we don’t give up seeking Him we will find Him.
- God will fight for us if we stand for Him.

What should we do to remember what things God has done?
How can we avoid forgetting about what God has done and what His promises are?

Activity:

Have everyone write down different things that God has done for them. Put the paper into a jar to be read.
