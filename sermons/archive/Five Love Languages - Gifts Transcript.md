00:00:01	okay so we are going to continue uh this evening with a series that I've been teaching about the five love languages of God we had gotten through the first three of those Pop Quiz anybody remember what those first three might have been of the five love languages yes ma'am physical touch was one that was definitely one of them um words of affirmation that was one of them were you here for that one yeah you might have been yeah acts of service acts of service was not one of them but that is going to be the Fifth and final oh

00:00:32	okay uh gifts is what we're doing today which leaves quity quality time very good all right that's okay um so along the theme of gifts again thinking about the ways in which we can speak a language that speaks love to God in a way that he wants to receive it because ultimately that's what matters right it's not just the way we want to say we love God it's the way he wants to be loved by us that is the main theme and one of the languages that God has that he wants us to speak to him is gifts and

00:01:16	particular offering our lives as a gift now in the Old Testament many times when you would offer a gift to God it was called an offering or a sacrifice so you'll see that sort of terminology used in the New Testament as well when we talk talk about offering our lives as a gift to God um so first thing I want to ask and this is not rhetorical I do want you to kind of talk about it for a second what does it mean do you think to love God with our lives what are some ways that we can love God with our

00:01:43	actual life Kayla um like doing things against our flesh like making decisions that are outside of what are yeah I don't know doing things that are uncomfortable our flesh wants and choosing to do the opposite okay for the sake of suffering for the sake of walking with him showing him to others so sometimes I think what to add to what Miss kale is saying is sometimes what God wants from us what obedience looks like even what it means to have a relationship with God can take discipline discipline by its very nature

00:02:22	is difficult not easy and it can make us uncomfortable but we apply ourselves to discipline because we believe or we we we desperately want a relationship with him in fact all relationships take work right some take less than others the difficulty in having a relationship with God is anyone want to guess you can't see him you can't see him now do you think he's aware of this yes yes so you think there's some Grace there as we are trying to get to know an invisible God there is some Grace there he's

00:02:58	understanding of its difficulty for us us okay uh what are some other ways we can love God Shay just um finding the time to spend him yes still this quiet prayer and seeking his will for you yeah yeah like all those things those are really good suggestions anyone else so way singing okay well how do we love God with our lives still singing okay okay Esme like that story with the three guys that love God they risk their life to get bned that's very true Shadrach mhach and Abednego yeah they sacrificed a lot

00:03:51	potentially right they thought they were going to be burned alive for their love for God were they burned alive no no they weren't very good example as me anyone else the ways we can love God with our lives John I think of the shama that we used to practice every day and what that actually means in the shal okay about when we say that I love hero is real Our God God is one love him with all of your heart all of your SM like the what we think about yeah so our intentions in loving God like it's an

00:04:27	intentional not just saying no I think I love this verion yeah but the way you know so it's an intentional part of our heart of focused on God and having to constantly renew that Focus yeah because as we go through work and school and studying or we tend to drift away from that thought of thinking about God yeah you know or worship on the Sabbath you know coming here it's easy to focus on God here but then in our day-to-day lives tend to kind of drift away from what we know we wake up and have some

00:05:02	prayer time we're feeling close go an hour or two and kind of you know we got continually come back to yeah yeah to to kind of re reframe what you're saying what I hear is that part of loving God with our lives is loving God daily that's what I hear Mr John saying and from within Right From the Inside Out not from the outside in uh I think these are all very valid points I agree with all you guys so let's look at the what the scriptures say about what it means to love God with our lives um now the

00:05:32	truth is that many people equate loving God with abstaining from sin this is certainly true that you know to refrain from hatred or murder is a way of loving God with your life but loving God with your life is not just about abstaining from things that are evil or harmful or hurtful right loving God also means actually surrendering to his will if you think about it when God created each and every one of you he didn't create you and sort of set you off on your own to go find your own way and maybe you find

00:06:04	a life of purpose and maybe you don't that is not the intention with which God created each and every one of you the fact is is that when God created each of us he created us with purpose he saw our lives woven like a thread through a tapestry right we're all woven together but each of us has our own path and our own purpose and we are not without purpose we have purpose and so it's part of that purpose which I'm going to call God's will that he wants you to fulfill as part of living your life in a way that loves him so

00:06:41	let's read uh Romans 12 uh verses 1 and two I'd like a volunteer to read that Joshua I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable to God which your reasonable service with which your reasonable service do not confirm conform to the pattern of this world but but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will God now I will admit to you here good job Joshua uh this is the Apostle

00:07:28	Paul writing to the church in Rome and he's a bit wordy here but this is one of the most well-known verses in all of the Bible so I want to break it down for us just a little bit because what he's saying here is really good first of all the word beseech not a word we use very commonly anymore but it almost means to beg or to compel you does this sound like something that Paul is really feels like is important right I'm begging you somebody says I'm begging you to do something do you think that they're

00:07:57	really desperate for you to do it really are this is the Paul Apostle Paul begging you begging me begging the church in Rome please by the mercy of God present yourself as a Living Sacrifice right remember sacrifice or offering is the same word we would think of as gift offer yourself your life as a gift to God it's part of the love language that he speaks right and he says this he says to be holy to be except able this is your reasonable service and other verses say your act of service or your act of

00:08:37	worship the way one of the ways in which we worship God is to offer our lives on a daily basis as an offering as a gift to him and he contrasts this with this do not conform to the pattern of this world and he says that the opposite of that which comes by being transformed because you've renewed your mind daily with Truth by listening to the still small voice of God's holy spirit you'll be transformed so that you won't be like the world you won't follow the pattern of the world and in fact you will follow

00:09:13	the will of God he says now that's interesting because we need to pay attention the will of God looks like the opposite of what the world does so if we look like the world what does that say about whether or not we're following the will of of God we're not in the will of we may not be following the will of God so the patterns of this world what are some examples of what you think Paul might be referring to what does the world how does the world behave towards one another self very selfishly chasing money greedy selfish

00:09:52	yeah greedy lust lustful just wanting things to make them feel good coveting be like other people oh never happy with who they are but always trying to be like someone else or something else that's very good what else how do they how else do they treat each other maybe treat themselves with unkindness yeah they're not very kind yeah whatever they want do they live at peace no what is the opposite of Peace stress anxiety worry fear right are they content with what they have no no what are they always doing I

00:10:30	want more seeking striving never content right yeah anything to fill the void that they feel right and there's a certain lostness and Brokenness and Desperation to the ways of the world and friends if we follow that same pattern it will be very hard for us to also keep the will of God right and in fact look looking at our own lives we can see that if we do follow that pattern that tends to be the way we are perhaps we have fallen out of God's will for our life we've busied ourselves with things that are maybe good but not God

00:11:14	right just an extra o in there all right let's move on point number two uh number two forgot to say my my top points here number one our lives are a gift to God number two I want us to beware of surface sacrifice number three partial obedience is complete Rebellion number four the sacrifice I want to talk about the sacrifice that truly pleases God and then Fifth and final point I want to talk about do not despise Small Beginnings okay so Point number two beware of surface sacrifice this is the story of ananas and sa which

00:12:01	I'm going to summarize for you because it's 11 verses long okay this is probably one of the scariest stories in the Bible this is a story in the New Testament not the Old Testament some people think that oh God just dealt differently with people back then and you know he was angry back then and but now he's just so full of grace and he's just like everything's gravy this is a story that happened after Jesus established the church after Jesus poured out his Spirit upon all flesh after Jesus ascended into heaven right

00:12:39	after Jesus charged the disciples to go and make disciples right this is the church that we are talking about is very well established at this point in other words you might say that this is the same church that you and I are a part of today and that is the context in which this story happens so here it is ananas and his wife suff they sold a piece of property and they conspired to withhold just a small portion of the proceeds of selling that property and they were going to give it to the church so they brought it but

00:13:14	they pretended they pretended to give the full amount of the offering of selling the property and they came up and Peter told the Holy Spirit told him what had happened they didn't tell him the Holy Spirit told him and Peter Peter walked walked up the Bible says full of the Holy Spirit he confronts ananas and he asks him why he chose to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back a portion of the money now pause there for a second he's not accusing him of not giving everything that is not the problem the problem is not that you

00:13:51	didn't give in fact you didn't have to give anything ananas it's the fact that you wanted to appear as if you were so generous and yet you were holding back and he says this Peter says to him as a result of their deceit both ananas and saf they felt dead in front of the entire church they just fell dead this caused great fear respect for God if you will to fall over all the people in the church as it would anywhere a new testament story of such a what seems like on the surface such a small compromise on the surface so I say to

00:14:39	you in point number two is beware of surface sacrifice the problem here is not that an of fire didn't want to give the full price to the property the problem is that they lied to the Holy Spirit and they lied to themselves and they lied to the apostles by wanting to look as if they were fully devoted while inside they knew they weren't so the question I want you to ask yourself and this is rhetorical so just ask yourself are there areas in your life where you're only partially surrendered to God but outwardly presenting yourself

00:15:15	as if you are fully committed that is the sin of ananas and of Fire Point number three partial obedience is complete Rebellion that sounds harsh doesn't it let's read this story um or at least the summary of the story in Joshua chapter 6 and 7 actually after the fall of Jericho remember what happened at Jericho what story what part of the story is this the wall yeah the walls came tumbling down right okay so the city of Jericho has been destroyed and God has shown himself so powerful as they marched around the

00:15:50	city seven times and blew the trumpet seven times and all this beautiful symbolism this is the first big victory in the promised land that God has brought the people into that's already been won that battle has been won ready with me so it's after the fall of Jericho that God commanded the Israelites to devote all the spoils of Jericho to him Spoils of War right so we're talking about the livestock and the gold and the silver and all the precious stones and all these all these things that were left behind right God

00:16:23	said those are for me this is not to make you rich I have other ways of making you rich right and so that's the command everybody with me devote all the spoils of Jericho to me however there was a guy named aen and he's about to be Akin Akin secretly and here's the Here's the the the key word secret right he secretly kept back some of these devoted items for himself he buried them in his tent while pretending to obey God's command fully ho now as a result of his Disobedience Israel lost the next battle

00:17:04	to a city called Ai and it was revealed that aan sin had brought judgment upon the entire nation right lots of people died in that battle because God wasn't with them because of ain's sin so it wasn't you know in the story of ananas and saf they died but now aan sin is causing other people to die all because of partial we might call it obedience partial obedience is complete rebellion and so here the question is rhetorical just think to yourself that if your partial obedience is hurting your family is it hurting our church is

00:17:53	it hurting the Lost members of your community because you're only partially obedient Isaiah 30:1 says this somebody would like to volunteer to read Jaden woe to the rebellious children says the Lord who takes counsel but not of me and who devises and who devis plans but not of my spirit that they may add to sin now I submitted to you that the idea of loving God with our life is not just about obstain gaining from hateful hurtful things it is 100% about submitting to his purpose for your life and here we've already read two stories

00:18:39	of these this sort of example of like being partially devoted to God on the surface but here Isaiah says this woe to the what kind of children rebell rebellious children says the Lord who take counsel just means they take advice but not of me so who do you think they're taking counsel from anyone but God or even people who say that they love and know God and they are not walking absolutely yeah second part you devise plans how many of us have plans we all have plans but he says this but your Des

00:19:19	you're devising plans they are not of my spirit I have a plan for you declares the Lord and it is a plan to to prosper you and to give you a hope and a future why would you reject my plan for your plan and here God says you are rebellious and you do these things that you may add what sin to sin guys this is such a serious matter for God to abort his purpose and his plan for your life is Grievous to him it is sinful to him it breaks his heart and it separates you from him in every way the Hebrew word for rebellious here

00:20:10	means obstinate defiant stubborn everybody knows what the word stubborn is right like a mule the Rebellion here is against God's Will and the second point to notice here is often times this theme you'll see it throughout the the book of Isaiah uh Israel was often rebellious how by making alliances with Egypt so we can think about what it means to Rebel it thinks about Miss Kayla talked earlier about the idea of giving our God our lives to God sometimes means just living in a way that's uncomfortable well Egypt represents

00:20:46	everything that's comfortable Egypt represents our world literally like it is a symbol of our world and what's and seeking what's comfortable what makes me feel good at least in the moment what gives me my wants my desires yeah right do as thou Wilt If It Makes You Happy it can't be that bad this is the Mantra of our world this is the Mantra of Egypt and this is what Israel was also guilty of this is the kind of rebellion that they went to over and over and over and over again and God says this you devise your own

00:21:21	plans but not in my spirit you're listening to the Council of the world and you're adding sin to sin to sin Point number four here is the sacrifice that truly pleases God I want to tell you one last story this is story of King Saul the first king of Israel was Saul and there was a prophet named Samuel in that day and God through the prophet Samuel commanded Saul to completely destroy this clan of where they're called the amalekites okay and these were actually Giants Nephilim okay they were like

00:22:01	hybrid humans with six fingers and six toes and they ate children and weren't really really happy go-lucky people okay so God says please destroy them and all their possessions as an act of divine judgment now listen to this they were supposed to destroy their possessions not take their possessions so in Joshua's story he said take the possessions and they are to be dedicated to me in this case he says destroy them there for no one right now part of their reason is because their possessions were golden idols and silver

00:22:38	idols and wooden idols and he wanted those things destroyed not adopted or devoted however here's what the first king of Israel did he partially obeys think about that remember what is partial obedience is complete what yeah Disobedience or Rebellion so Saul partially obeys the man but he spares the king AAG and he keeps the best of the livestock supposedly as a sacrifice to the Lord now what did God say destroy destroy it did he ask for it to be devoted to him no he said destroy it and yet Saul has this idea this plan

00:23:25	he doesn't consult God about it but he says oh you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to take all the best of the livestock and we're going to offer it as sacrifice when Samuel confronts Saul about his Disobedience Saul defends his actions and claiming the livestock was spared to be a sacrifice to God and here is Samuel's response to Saul Amy we read that has the Lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to Obe is better than sacrifice and to heed than the fat of

00:24:02	Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because you have rejected the word of the Lord he also has rejected you from being King strong strong words from the prophet Samuel I want us to notice a few things first of all here we're talking about offerings and sacrifices and I'm telling you offer your life as a sacrifice but Samuel makes a point he says that to obey is better than sacrifice in other words it's not just about the surface thing you're offering

00:24:41	it's about your heart your heart ananas and saf it was not about the surface amount of money they were giving to help the poor it was about what the heart and so God says the same thing he says listen this this is what God calls this act your sacrifice your worship is rebellion it's iniquity it's idolatry it's sin to me because you rebelled against my will and Samuel says because you've rejected the word of Yahweh I have rejected you as being King psalm 51:17 somebody want to read that verse Pauline My Sacrifice oh God is a

00:25:35	broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart you God will not despise it's a beautiful verse and again it reinforces this point here which is that the sacrifice that truly pleases God according to Psalm 51 what is the sacrifice that David offers God that's so pleasing a broken heart and the words broken and contrary it means to be crushed to powder guys there's nothing left of our plan and our purpose and our will when we present Our Lives as a sacrifice to him when we present our heart to him it's like presenting the softest of clay

00:26:19	for him to mold sometimes what people bring to him is this heart of granite and you know Granite honestly it's a terrible Stone to carve with there's a reason you don't see Granite statues everywhere Z stuff is just the toughest of material it might be everywhere around here but it's the worst when it comes to sculpting something Granite is not the stuff you want to work with but clay clay God can work with we need our hearts to be surrendered to him as a sacrifice as an offering as a gift that he can

00:27:05	mold so I want you to ask yourself this question if your life is an offering to him what does that offering look like does it look like something that would be soft and pable God here you do with this life what you want to do oh capable God and King and Creator or do we hand him a heart of Stone shielded and protected because we got our own plans and purposes locked away inside there but not mess with those but maybe you can spray some gold paint on the outside of this rock that's about all I'm

00:27:40	allowing what is the offering you're giving to him look like Fifth and final point do not despise Small Beginnings there's a verse in Zechariah 4:10 that says this for who has despised the day way of small things and this is in context of something very important here's why it's relevant to our point this is in the context of God telling his people to rebuild the Temple that they had built for him that had been completely destroyed it was in utter ruins it was gross guys it was not a pretty site anymore it used to be

00:28:24	Solomon's Temple this glorious glorious Temple this place where you could feel and sense the presence of God and that had since departed and God says go rebuild it and I will fill it now there's this sense of hopelessness that the people feel as they look on these ruins and they're like do you see how messed up this place is why are you asking us to rebuild do you know how long this is going to take do you know how long it took the first time and that was under King Solomon's Rule and he kind of had everything and we got kind

00:28:54	of nothing there was this desperation and this like fr rtion of like how are we supposed to ever accomplish something so huge how will this ever how will the former glory of this place ever be restored and yet you're asking us to begin to restore it and God says to them for who has despised the day of small things I'm not asking you to rebuild it in one day I'm asking you to start small and so you might feel very challenged by this message maybe even overwhelmed by God I just keep but I keep I don't know where to find the I'm

00:29:35	trying I'm trying God I I want to do this I want to spend time with you I want to be surrendered to you I want my heart to be clay in your hands but I feel so overwhelmed by how far away I am for where I want to be and God says I understand but don't despise small Beginnings start small I'm willing to start small with you you don't have to rebuild everything tomorrow or today but you can start today by bringing me something that you know is pleasing so Zechariah 4:10 reminds us that the smallest of Beginnings those

00:30:25	modest seemingly insignificant steps of obedience are not to be underestimated even if progress seems slow or the results are not immediately visible God values the heart Behind these acts of faithfulness last question what small beginning have you been holding back from God because you've allowed analysis paralysis to keep you from ever getting started to begin with like God what's the point of me offering anything if I can't offer everything but God says listen I am willing to start small give me something to work

00:31:13	with and you've been holding that back holding back just that small thing that you know you could give but you don't because you think what's the point God says no I want that do you mind if I decide if I want or don't I want that small beginning can I have that I can work with that there's a verse I can't remember exactly what book it's from I think it's Isaiah he says that a smoking candle he will not quench that's kind what does that mean have you ever seen a candle like after it's been blown out and there's

00:31:57	just smoke and there's just maybe if you look close enough the tiniest little Ember left on that Wick sometimes we feel like that like the light has almost completely gone out like is there really anything left here to be redeemed or offered to you God and God said a smoking candle I will not quench I'm not gonna snuff out what's left in fact I can work with this I can turn that tiny Ember back into a flame I can make this light again so I want you to remember more than anything else no matter how far or

00:32:44	distant you might feel from where you want to be or where you feel like God's calling you to give him what you've got no matter how small let him be God make space for him to show you what he can do with the smallest of sacrifices and let's build from there let's pray father we thank you so much that you're a God who will not quench will not smother the smallest of Embers left inside of us God we might feel like there's just nothing left but smoke we might look ahead of us and feel so terrible about how far we are from

00:33:30	you we might feel overwhelmed that your will just seems foreign to us almost but God I know because I have been there before in moments where I thought to myself it's not worth even giving what I've got because I'm just so far away but I've seen you work with the smallest remnant of light and Hope so father I pray today we would not despise Small Beginnings but would instead surrender our hearts as clay in your hands to do something awesome with make us today God what we cannot do on our own help us to know your will and to

00:34:22	walk in your will we pray these things in yeshua's name amen am amen
