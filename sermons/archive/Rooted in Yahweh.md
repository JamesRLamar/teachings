**Jeremiah 17**
5 Thus says Yahweh:
Cursed is the man who trusts in man
And makes flesh his strength,
Whose heart departs from Yahweh.

6 For he shall be like a shrub in the desert,
**And shall not see when good comes,**
But shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,
In a salt land which is without life.

7 Blessed is the man who trusts Yahweh,
And whose hope is Yahweh.

8 For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, 
which spreads out its roots by the river, 
**and does not see when heat comes.** 
And his leaf shall be green, 
and in the year of drought he is not anxious, 
nor does he cease from yielding fruitâ€‹.

13 O Yahweh, the **hope** of Israel...
**The fountain of living waters**.

**Galatians 5: 16** 
And I say: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not **accomplish** the lust of the flesh.

**Accomplish** - to do as commanded

**Galatians 5: 25** 
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

## What does it mean to be Rooted in the Living Water

- Being rooted in The Living Water means we don't look for a feeling to confirm if He is with us, but instead we simply trust that He is and look with expectation for Him to be revealed.
	- Do you regularly struggle emotionally or spiritually because you expect to "feel God", but can't?
	- Instead of expecting to "feel God", what should you expect?
- Being rooted means being able to quickly sense when we are off-balance and easily adjust ourselves to rebalance. 
	- How long does it take for you to realize if you've started to stray from Yeshua as your source of Life? 
	- Is your life characterized as being full but balanced? 
	- If not, what can you do to become more sensitive to shifts in your devotion to Him?
- Being rooted means being firmly set, entangled, or bound. In other words, it's not easy to go back to Egypt (serving selfish and fleshly desire) 
	- Do you find yourself regularly having to walk back from Egypt? 
	- Is every other week a toss-up of if you lived just like the rest of the world? 
	- Do you walk deeply and authentically in the Spirit?
	- What can you do to plant yourself more firmly in Him so that it's hard to walk away, not easy?
- Being rooted means drawing life from the source you are rooted in. You do not look for affirmation or confirmation outside the source. Your confidence comes from your source. 
	- The test is to ask yourself what do you trust in? 
	- What or whom do you rely on to make you feel good or happy?
- Being rooted means being grounded, consistent, steady, and reliable. It means you are not a wave tossed to and fro. You are not chaff blown about by the slightest of breeze. 
	- Are you the picture of steady? 
	- Do you exemplify consistency? 
	- How resilient are you when things are difficult, ambiguous, or unexpected?
	- What can you do to become more consistent and resilient?
- Being rooted means you find deep satisfaction in the Truth. You are moved by His Words. You are in awe of His Law. 
	- Do you find delight in His Words and precepts? 
	- Are you known for regularly walking and talking with Him? 
	- Does meditation upon His Word day and night characterize you? 
	- Does your schedule reflect a life that puts a relationship with Yeshua as a priority above all else?
	- What things in your daily practice need to change to respect God as All?
- Being rooted in the Living Water means streams of living water flow from you as well. 
	- Are you known to pour forth wisdom from above? 
	- Do your conversations challenge and inspire change in others? 
	- Does your love for Him draw others to love Him?
	- What needs to change in your life to make you a source of Life?


## Breakout Questions:

We talked about being rooted in Yeshua and what that means on a daily basis. There are three questions I wanted us each to answer in written form and review every day as a reminder. Ultimately, every day and every decision we make, we are choosing to make something suffer. If we choose to seek Him first thing in the morning, we are then choosing to make planning and preparation for work or the events of that day to suffer to some degree. If in the middle of the day we choose to grind through our lunch break instead of pause and recenter our focus on Him, we are choosing to let our soul suffer in order to get ahead on work or worldly responsibilities. Every choice we make causes something to suffer. We need to be wise and aware of what things we are choosing to make suffer and what things we are choosing to make great. 

Choosing to make something great is also very intentional as we might also make choices to spread ourselves so thin in trying to do everything that we actually just make everything suffer, our soul, our family, our health, and our responsibilities. Choosing to make something great in your life means choosing it always above the things that are less important. Choose you this day what is most important and let your daily decisions stand by that resolution.
