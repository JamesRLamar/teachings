**Ecclesiastes 12:13-14**
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:
Fear God and keep His commandments,
For this is man’s all.
For God will bring every work into judgment,
Including every secret thing,
Whether good or evil.

**TS2009**

Let us hear the conclusion of the entire matter: Fear Elohim and **guard** His commands, for this applies to all mankind!

More accurately, we do not keep God's Law as a set of rules, we guard them as boundaries to preserve life.

The Commandments written with the hand of God resided in the heart of the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark resided at the heart of the Temple. We are now the Temple and we must guard those Commandments and keep them at the center of our thoughts and intentions always.

**1 Corinthians 6:19-20**

Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.

**Proverbs 4:23**
Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life.

All Ten Commandments address the 3 A's, Affection, Attention, and Acceptance

**Exodus 20:17**

You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.

The word, covet, means desire or lust.

It's not about possession it's about possessiveness.

The commandment is also about status or desiring status, which is desiring the attention, affection and acceptance of others.

**‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭6:5-8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬**

Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ; **not with eye-service, as men-pleasers**, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free.

Do everything as unto Him, not unto them.

**What are the symptoms of coveting acceptance from others?**

**How do we guard ourselves from something so internal as desire?**

Focusing on the affection, attention, and acceptance of God is ultimately the cure for our sickness, not trying to transform ourselves from the outside in.
