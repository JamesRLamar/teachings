How do different theological perspectives reconcile Abraham or Enoch’s salvation? It’s one thing to say that Jews are saved through the Mosaic covenant, but I think Abraham still breaks that mold because he did not have the law of Moses, even if he had circumcision. Enoch broke that mold, and what are we to say about Rahab, the prostitute?

**Romans 2:12-16**
For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law (for not the hearers of the law are just in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be justified; for when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do the things in the law, these, although not having the law, are a law to themselves, who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them) in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.

The difference between having the Law written on the heart comes down to what kind of heart it is written on. Once trust has been established, the Spirit of God transforms the heart from a heart of stone to a heart of flesh.

**Hebrews 8:8-12**
Because finding fault with them, He says: “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah—not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.”

**Hebrews 8:8**
"new": unknown, strange, anew, afresh

**Jeremiah 31:31**
"new": become new, renewed, rejuvenate

**Ephesians 2:8-9**
> "For by grace you have been saved"

**Period?**

"through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."

**What kind of faith?**

### James 2:14-26 (NKJV):

> "What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him?...Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. 
> 
> But someone will say, 'You have faith, and I have works.' Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? 
> 
> Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, 'Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.' And he was called the friend of God. You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. 
> 
> Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way? For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."

### 1 John 2:3-6 (NKJV):

> "Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, 'I know Him,' and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked."


**What is justice?**

Justice means to uphold the law or bring into fair balance what is right or wrong. 

### Romans 5:1 (NKJV):

> "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

**Period?**

"through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand"

**Is it just for those who break the law to go free without punishment?**

No, so how are we justified?

### Romans 8:3 (NKJV):

> "For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh."

**Period?**

"that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit"

### Galatians 2:16 (NKJV):

> "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified."

### Galatians 5:6 (NKJV):

> "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love."



### Revelation 13:8 (NKJV):

> "All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
