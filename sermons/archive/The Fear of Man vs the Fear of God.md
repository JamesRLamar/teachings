**What is the root cause of the fear of man?**

The fear of Gan is based on trust in God, therefore, the fear of man is based on trust in man.

**Psalm 56:11**
In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

**Proverbs 29:25**
The fear of man brings a snare, But whoever trusts in the Lord shall be safe.

Another way of saying this is that if we fear man, we must not trust God, but if we fear God, we won't trust in man.

**Deuteronomy 10:12â€“13**

And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to **fear** the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to **serve** the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD, which I am commanding you today for your good?

**So how do we combat the fear of man if we genuinely feel afraid?**

We don't stuff our emotion, we just choose not to respect feelings that are contrary to our commitments. In the same way temptation may try to lure us away from faithfulness to our spouse, we do not sin because we are tempted. We sin when we choose to indulge those feelings in our heart.

Consider for a moment what the opposite of the fear of man looks like.
