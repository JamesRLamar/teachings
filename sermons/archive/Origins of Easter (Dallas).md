Without going to far into the details on the exact origins of the holiday we now know as Easter; It is apparent that some of the traditions and symbols associated with Easter like Easter eggs and the Easter bunny are at least loosely associated with symbols of fertility in ancient paganism and certainly do not have their origin in the scriptures.

But what about the day of Easter itself?

- The church likely did not start celebrating the resurrection of Christ until around 150ish years after Jesus.
- Evidence suggests that the celebration of Christ’s resurrection on Sunday, and the moving of the day of worship to Sunday, originated from churches in Rome and Alexandria.
- Evidence also suggests that the churches in Asia, such as the church at Ephesus, continued to keep the Passover on the 14th day of the firs month of the Jewish Calendar according to the custom that had been kept for thousands of years.

But what do the Scriptures say?

- There is nothing in scripture that commands us to celebrate the resurrection. However, we are commanded to remember His death.

“For I received from the Master that which I also delivered to you: that the Master יהושע in the night in which He was delivered up took bread, and having given thanks, He broke it and said, “Take, eat, this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the renewed covenant in My blood. As often as you drink it, do this in remembrance of Me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the death of the Master until He comes.”

‭‭         (1 Corinthians)‬ ‭11‬:‭23‬-‭26‬ ‭TS2009‬‬

- The scene of the first communion where Jesus was eating with His disciples was over the Passover meal. Jesus in that moment was making the connection between himself and the Passover lamb and I believe commanding His disciples to continue celebrating Passover but now it would be in remembrance of Him and would also serve as a reminder that He intends to come again.

“And taking bread, giving thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body which is given for you, do this in remembrance of Me.””

‭          ‭Luqas (Luke)‬ ‭22‬:‭19‬ ‭TS2009‬‬

Some of the evidence for much of the early church practicing the Passover as originally set forth in Exodus can be found in a letter written from a bishop named Polycrates who presided over the church in Ephesus to the bishop of the church in Rome at the time.

**LETTER:**

*From His Epistle to Victor and the Roman Church Concerning the Day of Keeping the Passover.*

*As for us, then, we scrupulously observe the exact day, neither adding nor taking away. For in Asia great luminaries have gone to their rest, who shall rise again in the day of the coming of the Lord, when He cometh with glory from heaven and shall raise again all the saints.*

*I speak of Philip, one of the twelve apostles, who is laid to rest at Hierapolis; and his two daughters, who arrived at old age unmarried; his other daughter also, who passed her life under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and reposes at Ephesus; John, moreover, who reclined on the Lord’s bosom, and who became a priest wearing the mitre, and a witness and a teacher—he rests at Ephesus.*

*Then there is Polycarp, both bishop and martyr at Smyrna; and Thraseas from Eumenia, both bishop and martyr, who rests at Smyrna. Why should I speak of Sagaris, bishop, and martyr, who rests at Laodicea? of the blessed Papirius, moreover? and of Melito the eunuch, who performed all his actions under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and lies at Sardis, awaiting the visitation from heaven, when he shall rise again from the dead?*

*These all kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in accordance with the Gospel, without ever deviating from it, but keeping to the rule of faith. Moreover, I also, Polycrates, who am the least of you all, in accordance with the tradition of my relatives, some of whom I have succeeded—seven of my relatives were bishops, and I am the eighth, and my relatives always observed the day when the people put away the leaven—I myself, brethren, I say, who am sixty-five years old in the Lord, and have fallen in with the brethren in all parts of the world, and have read through all Holy Scripture, am not frightened at the things which are said to terrify us. For those who are greater than I have said, “We ought to obey God rather than men.”*

*I might also have made mention of the bishops associated with me, whom it was your own desire to have called together by me, and I called them together: whose names, if I were to write them down, would amount to a great number. These bishops, on coming to see me, unworthy as I am, signified their united approval of the letter, knowing that I wore these grey hairs not in vain, but have always regulated my conduct in obedience to the Lord Jesus.*

- This letter was written in 195 AD and highlights some of the conflict between many churches in the world and the church in Rome on this issue.
- Some of the main things to take away from this letter are what appears to be the early churches ardent belief in keeping the 14th day Passover and the list of people Polycrates associates with this practice including the apostle John.

What are we then to take away from this information?

- There seems to be an impetus for us to remember the feast of Passover and its symbolism surrounding Jesus.
- There is nothing abjectly sinful with recognizing Jesus’ resurrection, but we should separate that from worldly influences, and we should certainly give more weight to the things the scriptures actually call us to practice and remember.
