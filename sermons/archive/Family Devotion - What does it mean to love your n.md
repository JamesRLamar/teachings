**What is the Shema?**

**What else is the Shema a reminder of ?**

**Matthew 22:35-36 paraphrase**

Someone who was an expert in the Bible, tested Jesus with this question: “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Bible?”

**Matthew 22:37-38 paraphrase**

Jesus replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment.

**Matthew 22:39-40 paraphrase**

And the second is like it: "Love your neighbor as yourself." The entire teaching of the Bible hangs on these two commandments.

**Love you neighbor as yourself**

**How do we do this?**

We need to think about how we want a true friend to treat us.

**What qualities do we want in a good friend?**

- kind
- patient
- good listener
- tells the truth in love
- defends us if someone speaks badly about us
- laughs when we laugh
- cries when we cry
- encourages us when we are down
- challenges us when we are lost

**What kind of friend do you think God is?**
