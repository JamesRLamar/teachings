Andrew Huberman discusses a mechanism in the frontal part of our brain that we can trigger through conscious effort by repeatedly telling ourselves that the effort and pain is the real pleasure or reward. He goes on to quote the findings of a Standford Univ. study which essentially revealed that receiving a reward after an activity actually diminished the intrinsic satisfaction of just doing the activity. In other words, even activities are naturally enjoyable become less enjoyable or even painful if we consistently received reward at the completion of the exercise. This is doubly true for activities are are not enjoyable by nature, like work or exercise.

If we focus on the end as the only real reward, like the grade, the attaboy, the accomplishment, then we will systematically train our brain to miss enjoying the journey and create a negative feedback look of dopamine which ultimately leads to depression, frustration, and boredom.

The solution is to trigger a mechanism of the brain which releases dopamine during the activity or exercise. We do that, as I said before, by basically repeating to ourselves the mantra that the pleasure is in the pain.

What an interesting observation when we consider James 1:2-3 says to "Consider it *joy* when you face testing of many kinds, knowing that the testing of your faith produces *patience*."

**Joy** - cheerfulness, delight, gladness

**Patience** - hopeful endurance

The Growth Mindset as it is called, is this process of finding joy in the trial. It is liking coaching oneself and encouraging oneself through the pain. The antithesis of the Growth Mindset might be the Result Mindset or the Comparison Mindset. That is a mindset which only derives satisfaction from performance or from the perception of performance in comparison to others. That mindset leads to sure disappointment.
