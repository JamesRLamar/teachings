## 1. How Can We Love God by Acts of Service?

**Matthew 22:37-39**  
*37 Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."*  
*38-39 This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."*

- Jesus emphasizes that loving God wholeheartedly is the greatest commandment, closely followed by loving others.  
- Acts of service are a direct expression of our love for God. Loving those who are made in His image is an extension of loving Him.  
- It's not just about grand gestures; everyday acts—listening, helping a friend in need, or praying for someone—reflect this love.

## 2. How Are You Serving Others Day to Day?

**1 John 4:20**  
*If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?*

- Loving others is the visible evidence of our invisible love for God. We can’t claim to love Him if we fail to love the people around us.  
- Reflect on the opportunities God gives you daily to demonstrate love.  
- Are there individuals in your circle who could benefit from your intentional acts of service?

## 3. What Does Our Time Say About Where Our Heart Is?

**Matthew 6:21**  
*For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.*

- This verse challenges us to examine where we invest our time, energy, and resources. How we spend our time is a reflection of our true priorities.  
- Consider what your schedule says about where your treasure lies.  
- Are you giving God the best of your day, or just what's left over?

## 4. What Acts of Service is God Pleased With?

**2 Corinthians 9:7**  
*So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.*

- God values the sincerity of our service, not the size. A small act done with a heart devoted to Him brings great delight.  
- Service that is given willingly and joyfully pleases God more than service given out of mere obligation.

## 5. Which Master Is Telling You "Well Done"?

**Matthew 25:14-30** (The Parable of the Talents)  
14-15 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them. And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey..."

20-21 So he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents besides them.’ His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'

26 But to the servant who hid his talent, "his lord answered and said to him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant'" 

29-30 For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

- The faithful servant receives a reward because he diligently used what was entrusted to him. The unfaithful servant faces consequences for burying his talent.  
- The parable isn’t about becoming something you are not; it’s about using what God has already put in your hands to serve others.  
- Reflect on what God has placed in your life to bless others.  
- Consider which masters are vying for your loyalty and attention.  
- This isn’t just about what we’ll hear at the end of our lives; it’s about hearing God’s “well done” in everyday moments.  
- Each day, you'll hear “well done” from one master or another. Which master is guiding your choices?

## Final Challenge

- What changes do you need to make to remove false masters from your life?  
- Are there acts of love and service that you’ve been holding back or hiding?  
- How can you more intentionally use the gifts and resources God has entrusted to you?
