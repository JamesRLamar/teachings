Last night we took turns taking a fresh mountain bath in the creek nearby. It was funny to watch the skepticism of each person who had never done this before. Thoughts of pain and extreme cold filled their heads, but nobody wanted to be the only one who wouldn’t do it. So with a little old fashioned peer pressure I got the whole crew to enjoy a brisk mountain bath.

John was the funniest. He jumped in and hurriedly washed his head and armpits. But shortly after immersing himself, the serenity set in. At some point when you’ve finally immersed yourself enough, the cold and pain goes away and you just feel life and warmth from the water. The cold water activates every cell in your body and you begin the feel alive like never before. Afterwards John jumped in the creek just for the fun of it and started making a pool.

Jesus is the river

“Jesus answered and said to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.” The woman said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water? Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?” Jesus answered and said to her, “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.””

The important lesson for us to learn is that following Jesus can be scary and will be costly, but it’s not something we can do part way. The life of following Jesus is meant to be all in, fully committed and fully immersed. We torture ourselves when we only toe the water or occasionally walk knee deep. Such halfhearted measures will never get us to the point of serenity with Jesus.

Where is your soul today?

How far deep are you in the life of following Jesus?

Does being fully immersed make you think only of what it might cost you rather than what you will gain?

Living your life weighing the comforts of every decision is a sure way to never experience the serenity and peace of Jesus. Only when we surrender all ourselves to the river that is. Christ will we know the eternal life He promises.
