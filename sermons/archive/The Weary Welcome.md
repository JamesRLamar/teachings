**Matthew 11:28–30**
"Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”

**"Labor"** - weary or tired to the point of "giving up"

# 10 Signs of a Weary Soul

1 - **Irritability**—You get mad, frustrated, or annoyed too easily. Little, everyday things irk you. People have to tiptoe around your ongoing low-grade negativity if not anger.

2 - **Willful Ignorance**—You regularly ignore the counsel of others or, worse, the Spirit. You know what would do your soul well, but you willfully neglect eternal things in exchange for momentary earthly substitutes.

3 - **Restlessness**—When you try to slow down and rest, you can’t relax. You give Sabbath a try, and you hate it. You read Scripture but find it boring. You have quiet time with God but can’t focus your mind.

4 - **Workaholism** (nonstop activity)—You don’t know when to stop. Or worse, you can’t stop. Result: you fall prey to “sunset fatigue,” where by day’s end, you have nothing left to give to your spouse, children, or loved ones. They get the grouchy, overtired you, and it’s not pretty.

5 - **Emotional numbness**—You can’t feel. You live in this kind of constant numb fatigue.

6 - **Out-of-order priorities**—You feel disconnected from your identity and calling. You’re always getting sucked into the tyranny of the urgent, not the important. You’re busier than ever before, yet you still feel like you don’t have time for what matters.

7 - **Lack of care for your body**—You don’t have time for the basics: eight hours of sleep a night; daily exercise; healthy, home-cooked food; minimal stimulants; margin. You gain weight. Get sick multiple times a year. Regularly wake up tired. Don’t sleep well. You live off the three primary food addictions: sugar, caffeine, or alcohol.

8 - **Escapist behaviors**—When we’re too tired to do what’s life-giving for our souls, we each turn to our distractions of choice: over-eating, over-indulging, over-consuming the internet. Some escapes can be good; but when we abuse them to escape from reality, they eat us alive. You find yourself stuck in the negative feedback loop of socially acceptable addictions.

9 - **Weak spiritual discipline**—If you’re anything like me when you get over-busy, the things that are genuinely life-giving for your soul are the first to go rather than your first go-to—such as a quiet time in the morning, Scripture, prayer, or a meaningful Sabbath.

10 - **Isolation**—You feel disconnected from God, others, and even your own soul. On those rare times when you stop to pray (and by pray I don’t mean ask God for stuff; I mean sit with God in the quiet), you’re so stressed and distracted that your mind can’t settle down long enough to enjoy the Father’s company.

**"Wilderness"** - a solitary quiet place

**Matthew 4:1**
"Then Jesus was ***led*** up by the Spirit into the ***wilderness*** to be tempted by the devil."

**"Led"** - of navigators: launch out, set sail, put to sea

**Mark 1:12**
"Immediately the Spirit ***drove*** Him into the ***wilderness***."

**"Drove"** - to cast out, drive out, send forth with the notion of violence, to expel or compel

**Mark 1:35**
"Now in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a ***solitary place***; and there He prayed."

**Luke 5:16**
"So He Himself often withdrew into the ***wilderness*** and prayed."

**1 Thessalonians 4:11**
"Make it your *ambition* to lead a *quiet* life..."

**Hebrews 4:9-11**
"Consequently, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His. Therefore let’s make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience."


**What if hearing God's voice is less about coaxing Him to speak and more about calming our minds to hear?**

**Which spirit have you been letting drive you?**
