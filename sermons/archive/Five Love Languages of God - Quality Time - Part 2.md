Is the quality and quantity of my time with God sufficient to help me thrive in difficult times, as well as in good times?

## 1. Yeshua Set the Pace

**Luke 5:16** 
Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.

**Mark 1:35**
Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.

**Mark 6:31-32**
And He said to them, “Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.” 

"Come to Me..."

> If we don’t regularly seek Him in quiet places when life gets loud, we will miss His voice entirely.

**Illustration:**  
On Monday night, I sat up for two hours trying to silence all the other voices. I kept returning to one statement that gave me rest: "Father, I only want to hear Your voice." While it took more effort than I would have liked, the clamor of worry and fear eventually became soft enough for me to hear my God speak.

Are you finding rest in Him?

Does each day end rested and restored or distracted and exhausted?

## 2. Spiritual Grit Comes Before the... Storm

**Daniel 6:10** 
Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home. And in his upper room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his knees three times that day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as was his custom since early days.

**Romans 5:3-5**
And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.  Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.

**1 Timothy 4:8**
Physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.

> Consistent and quality time with God prepared Daniel for the lions' den, Shadrach for the furnace, and Yeshua for the cross.

> Daily devotion is like “spiritual training” that builds up your endurance and resilience.

> Consistency over time is infinitely more potent than the intensity of any single moment of effort.

## 3. Are You Planted?

**Psalm 1:2-3**
But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever he does prospers.

**Jeremiah 17:7-8**
Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in Him. They will be like a tree planted by the water… it has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.

"Let your let so shine..."

If a storm hit your life tomorrow, would the storm find you planted or uprooted?

## 4. Where Are You?

**Genesis 3:8-9**
And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, “Where are you?”

Are you "hiding" from God?

Are you filling your schedule with "good" stuff while giving God the leftovers?

Just as we prioritize quality time in our most important human relationships, we must do the same in our relationship with God.

Is my devotion rooted enough to sustain me through a real storm?

Is my love for God deep enough to help me thrive in seasons of drought?
