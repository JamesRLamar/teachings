Samuel is a type of Christ. Several times it says that Samuel grew in wisdom and stature. Samuel was dedicated to God and grew up in the Temple. Samuel was established as a prophet and everything God spoke through him came to pass.

We read in Samuel 7 that Israel had become quite corrupt under the priesthood of Eli and his sons. Samuel’s message is really he same as John he Baptist and Christ Himself.

1 Samuel 7, we read a parallel story about the End Times. The great noise causes destruction to fall upon the Philistines and victory for those faithful to God. Repentance was the message.

2 Peter 3:10, The great noise

Here are the signs Peter tells us to look for:

- Scoffers who will mock the coming of Christ
- Scoffers who will deny the flood of Noah
- Scoffers who will say “peace and safety” yet sudden destruction will come upon them as a thief in the night
- Scoffers who will preach against the Word of God (Ten Commandments)
- Scoffers who will deny the literal Creation of the world in six days (this is significant, because the fourth Commandments makes such a claim)
- The 6,000 year plan of man. 1 day = 1,000 years, We are watching the sun set on the 6th day. The Sabbath (1,000 years of peace) is about to begin.
- The coming of the son of Man is like the days of Noah, Genesis 6:5. Every man’s heart has decided. One day, a man will be baptized and as he comes out of the water lightening will shoot across the sky and the whole earth will shake at the Coming of Christ, because there will be no soul left to repent.
