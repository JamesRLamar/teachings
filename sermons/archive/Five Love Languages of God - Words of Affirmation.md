## 1. Our Words and Thoughts Matter

**Matthew 12:36-37**
But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.

**Psalm 15:1–4**
1 Lord, who may abide in Your tabernacle? Who may dwell in Your holy hill? 

2 He who walks uprightly, And works righteousness, And speaks the truth in his heart; 

3 He who does not backbite with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor does he take up a reproach against his friend; 

## 2. Our Words Come from the Thoughts of Our Heart

**Matthew 12:34**  
For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

> What we think about others comes out in our words towards others

## 3. The Father of Light Speaks Words of Affirmation

**Psalm 139:17-18**  
How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they would be more in number than the sand; When I awake, I am still with You.

**Isaiah 30:21**  
Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, ‘This is the way, walk in it,’ Whenever you turn to the right hand Or whenever you turn to the left.

## 4. The Father of Lies Speaks Words of Accusation

**Job 1:6–11**

6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. 

7 And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?” So Satan answered the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.” 

8 Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?” 

9 So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? 

10 Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 

11 But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”

## 5. God's Words Cast Vision, but Satan's Kill Vision

**John 10:1–4**
1 Most assuredly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 

3 To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 

4 And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.

**John 10:10**  
The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.

## 6. God's Words Cover You with His Image, but Satan's Poke Holes in His Image

**Genesis 1:27**  
So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.

**Genesis 3:4–5**
Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

## 7. We Speak Like Our Fathers

**John 8:37–47**
37 I know that you are Abraham’s descendants, but you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you. 

38 I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with your father.

44 You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. 

47 He who is of God hears God’s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.
