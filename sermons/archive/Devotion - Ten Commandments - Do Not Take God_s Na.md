**Exodus 20:7**

You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.

**What does it mean to take someone’s name?**

**What does vain mean?**

**What does it mean to take God’s name in vain? **

**Adoption doesn’t occur because of how good we are but because of our fathers love and goodness. **

**Ephesians 4:1 ERV**

So, as a prisoner for the Lord, I beg you to live the way God’s people should live, because he chose you to be his.

**Romans 2:21-22 ERV**

You teach others, so why don’t you teach yourself? You tell them not to steal, but you yourself steal. You say they must not commit adultery, but you yourself are guilty of that sin. You hate idols, but you steal them from their temples.

**Romans 2:23-24 ERV**

You are so proud that you have God’s law, but you bring shame to God by breaking his law. As the Scriptures say, “People in other nations insult God because of you.”

**1 John 2:5-6 ERV**

But when we obey God’s teaching, his love is truly working in us. This is how we know that we are living in him. If we say we live in God, we must live the way Jesus lived.

It is because of Gods love for us that we are transformed and desire to obey Him and honor His name.
