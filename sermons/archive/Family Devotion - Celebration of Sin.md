We are about to read a story about a giant golden idol that an evil king wanted everyone to celebrate and worship. We know that worshipping idols is sinful, but I want us to see that the world makes golden images of all kinds of sin. There are many ways the world tries to put **gold paint on sin**. The world wants us to "pridefully" celebrate sin. Today, we will read about three young people who would not give in and celebrate sin.

**Daniel 3**

1-3 King Nebuchadnezzar built a golden image, ninety feet high and nine feet thick. He set it up in the middle of Babylon so everyone could see it. He then ordered all the important leaders in the country, everybody who was anybody, to the dedication ceremony of the golden image.

4-6 A messenger then proclaimed in a loud voice: "Attention, everyone! When you hear the band play—with all their instruments—fall to your knees and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has created. Anyone who does not kneel and worship shall be thrown immediately into a fiery furnace."

7 The band started to play, a huge band equipped with all the musical instruments of Babylon, and everyone fell to their knees and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

8-12 Just then, some Babylonian witches stepped up and accused God’s people—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—of not worshipping the golden image. The witches said, "These men are ignoring you, O king. They don’t respect your gods, and they won’t worship the golden image you created."

13-15 King Nebuchadnezzar was furious and ordered Shadrach and his two friends to be brought in. When the men were brought in, Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "I’m giving you a second chance. From now on, when the big band plays you must go to your knees and worship the golden image I have made. If you don’t worship it, you will be thrown into the fiery furnace. What god can rescue you from my power?"

16-18 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, "Your threat means nothing to us. If you throw us in the fire, the God we serve can rescue us from your fiery furnace and anything else you might do to hurt us. But even if God doesn’t, it won’t change anything. We still won't serve your gods or worship the golden image."

19-23 The king’s face turned purple with anger. He ordered the furnace heated up seven times hotter. Then he ordered Shadrach and his two friends to be bound hand and foot, and thrown into the roaring fire. The fire raged around all three of them.

24 Suddenly the king jumped up in alarm and said, "Didn’t we throw three men, bound hand and foot, into the fire? But look!” the king said. "I see **four** men, walking around in the fire, completely unharmed! And the fourth man looks like the son of the god!"

26-27 Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego walked out of the fire. Everyone saw that the fire didn’t even hurt a hair on their head, not a burn mark on their clothes, they didn’t even smell like smoke!

29 Then the king said, "Anyone anywhere, who says anything bad against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be ripped to pieces, limb from limb, and their houses torn down. There has never been a god who can save like their God can.”

30 Then the king promoted Shadrach and his two friends to be leaders of Babylon.

**What did King Nebuchadnezzar want everyone to do?**

Why did he give Shadrach and his friends a second chance?

**Why was it such a big deal to Shadrach and his friends did NOT worship the golden image?**

**What are some other images the world has made that they try to get us to worship?**

What does the celebration of sin look like today?

**What should you do when pressured to worship like the world does?**

**What do we have to be afraid of if we stand up for God?**
