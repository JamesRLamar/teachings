**James‬ ‭1‬:‭19‬-‭20**

So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.

**Hear** - To understand, to learn as giving ear to a teacher

**Understand** - The English etymology of the word means "to stand in midst of". The first part of the word, "under" comes from the same word we now use for "intestines"

**Slow** - Inactive

**Speak** - In this sense, to monologue, used also to refer to preaching and chatter from animals like dogs and apes

## A Fast Speaker is a Slow Learner

‭‭
**Wrath** - Anger, impulse, agitation of the soul

**Righteousness** - The state of him who is as he ought to be, correctness of thinking, feeling, and acting

We can prepare ourselves for offense if we "fore give" mercy. When we drive or get to work we should be prepared to already give mercy for any offense that should come our way.

"People don't care how much you know till they know how much you care."

"Seek first to understand, then to be understood"
