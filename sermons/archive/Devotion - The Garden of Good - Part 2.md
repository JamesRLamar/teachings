Last time we examined the need to acknowledge God's image as the source of what makes us truly good as He is good. We ended with a challenge**  **to look yourself in the mirror and deeply contemplate the statement, "I love you". The goal was to try not to move superficially through this exercise, but look yourself in the eyes and think about your past and present, your mistakes, sins, and shortcomings. Then ask yourself if you really love yourself.

**What does it look like to no longer live for ourselves but for Him who died for us?**

**What is the fruit of feeding the Holy Spirit of God within ourselves?**

**What does your life, your mood, your habits, and your thoughts look like?**

**Do you love yourself? Do you believe you are good and that you are enough?**
**

Answer these questions based how you generally feel about yourself throughout the week. Recognize these questions are subjective in nature. The question for each area of our life is do we do "enough". "Enough" is a feeling that may or may not be based on objective reality. These questions are supposed to have fuzzy answers and are only meant as a loose guide to discover what part of our lives need attention and how. Each question will have two "yes/no" answers.

If you answer "no", can you **immediately** and **specifically** identify what you need to be doing more of?

If you answer "yes", can you **immediately** and **specifically** identify what you are doing well?

1. For your career life, do you do enough?

1. For your financial life, do you do enough?

1. For your physical life, do you do enough?

1. For your spiritual life, do you do enough?

1. For your relational life with your church, do you do enough?

1. For your relational life with your family, do you do enough?

1. For your relational life with your friends, do you do enough?

In every area of our life, we either need to fight more or surrender more. But how do we know which is which? We can observe our answers above to help guide us.

- If you answered "yes" to anything, were you able to immediately identify something specific you are doing well?
    - If no, you may be deceiving yourself
    - If yes, you may need to talk with someone who knows you well to see if they agree with you and if so you are likely truly balanced in that area
- If you answered "no" to anything, were you able to immediately identify something specific you should be doing?
    - If no, you may need to let go and surrender more
    - If yes, you may need to talk with someone who knows you well to see if they agree or if you just need to surrender more

**Observation:**

Many people who fight too much, never think they do enough, but can't say what they need to do more of exactly. It's a **feeling** of not being enough.

**Observation:**

Many people who surrender too much, often think they are doing just fine. But their bliss is really just ignorance trying to avoid the feeling of discomfort that would arise from confrontation and needed change.

In either scenario above, **being aware** is the first step, and then **being willing** to confront the needed change.

**Being aware** can be painful, because it usually requires feeling hurtful emotions or acknowledging difficult truth.

**Being willing** is often combated by reluctance, distraction, and or excuses to delay.

**Observation:**

We often feel guilty or fearful of things we ought not to be concerned about. Conversely, we often feel no conviction for things that really do matter. These contradictions arise when we allow our conscience to be conditioned.

**1 Corinthians 5**

20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christâ€™s behalf, be reconciled to God. 21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
