Psalm 19:14
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
Be pleasing in Your sight,
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

Where do our words come from?
A: They come from our mind

There are words we speak with our mouths and words we speak only with our mind, but all words come from the heart.

What does meditation mean?
A: Inner thoughts and focus

The words we say inside are even more important that the words we say outside.

In this Psalm, King David is praying that the words of his mouth and his inner words of the heart would be **pleasing** to God.

Our words are kind of like food. We can eat all kinds of things. Some things are pleasing to eat meaning they taste good, but not everything that tastes good is good for us. We have to make good choices about what we eat if we want our bodies to be healthy. In the same way, we have to make choices about what thoughts we feed on if we want our souls to be healthy.

Psalm 19:14 says
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
Be pleasing in Your sight,
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

God wants to be our Rock. What do you think that means?

A: God wants to be our hiding place and the solid foundation of our life

God also wants to be our Redeemer. What do you think that means?

A: God wants save us from the result of our sins, which is death.

God promises us that if we will choose His thoughts over our thoughts that we will have life. That can be difficult because sometimes our thoughts are tasty and they can make us feel better at first.

Can you think of a time when someone hurt you or hurt your feelings?

Our thoughts might be to hurt them back and thinking about that might make us feel good at first. But if we feed those thoughts we will only get even more hurt. God wants us to think about what He would do. Remember Jesus tells us to let people harm us and love those who hate us. And that’s exactly what Jesus did. Jesus wasn’t afraid of what people could do to him.

So how can we do all this? How can we choose thoughts that are pleasing to God?

We have to think about what we are thinking about.

Especially when it comes to the words of our mouth. We have to think about those words BEFORE we say them. Are those words the same kind of words Jesus would say? That’s a question we need to ask ourselves before saying them. This goes for all the thoughts we may have throughout the day. In order for Psalm 19 to be true in our lives we have to:

Think about what we think about, and be careful to only feed God’s thoughts not our own.
