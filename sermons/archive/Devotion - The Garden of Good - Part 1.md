**Genesis 1**

26 Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”

27 So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.

28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”

31 Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was **very good**. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

**When you look at Creation do you agree with God that it is "very good"?**

**Would you agree that God is also "very good"?**

We are a part of that very good Creation and we are made in His image which is very good. At the core of who we are, we are like Him, we are very good. But our sinful choices do taint His divine nature within us. As unbelievers, we become slaves to a corrupt and sinful nature instead of the image of God upon us. As believers, we are made new and restored to the "very good" God intended.

**1 Corinthians 5**

17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.

As believers, many of us still see ourselves as bad at the core and struggling to make the tiniest part of ourselves good. However, the opposite is true. As new creations, we are not bad at the core trying to make small steps toward being better humans. That is mere self-help. If we can look at Creation and the Creator and agree whole heartily they are good then we must also agree that we are good. We must see our reflections in the mirror and say, "we are good because He is good".

Sin is real and the consequences thereof, but we must not see ourselves as wholly sinful once we have been transformed by God's Spirit living within us. We are new creations. After being regenerated, sin is more like cancer which needs to be cut off than a genetic disease which invades every fiber of our being.

**But the real question is "if" we are in Christ, what ought our life to look like?**

**1 Corinthians 5:15**

and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.

**What does it look like to no longer live for ourselves but for Him who died for us?**

**What is the fruit of feeding the Holy Spirit of God within ourselves?**

**What does your life, your mood, your habits, and your thoughts look like?**

**Do you love yourself? Do you believe you are good and that you are enough?**

The challenge this week is to look yourself in the mirror and deeply contemplate the statement, "I love you". Try not to move superficially through this exercise, but look yourself in the eyes and think about your past and present, your mistakes, sins, and shortcomings. Then ask yourself if you really love yourself.
