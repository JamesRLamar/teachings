How do we love God with all being?

- Schedule
- Free time
- Interests and hobbies
- Career/school
- Finances

These should be:

- Always surrendered
- Always centered on Him

Life consists of:

- Time
- Relationships
- Energy
- Emotions

These should always be protected

**Isaiah 26:3**

You will keep him in perfect peace, Whose *mind* is stayed on You, Because he trusts in You.

**Proverbs 4:23‬ ‭TS2009‬‬**

Watch over your heart with all diligence, For out of it are the sources of life.

‭‭
**Matthew‬ ‭6:19-21‬ ‭NKJV‬‬**

Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

Where your treasure is there your heart is. Time is the currency of Life. Money is the most superficial of all the questions.
