Psalm 18:19
He brought me out into a safe place; He rescued me because he delighted in me.

[Psalm 144:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20144%3A7&version=NKJV)

Stretch out Your hand from above; **Rescue** me and deliver me out of great waters

[Daniel 6:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%206%3A27&version=NKJV)

He delivers and **rescue**s, And He works signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
