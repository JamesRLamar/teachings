**When we don’t get our way, how do we act?**
**
**

**When something hurts us or makes us uncomfortable, what kind of words do we say?**

**
**

**How we suffer says a lot about who we really are. Let’s consider how Jesus suffered. **

Matthew 26:55-56 GW

At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal? I used to sit teaching in the temple courtyard every day. But you didn’t arrest me then. All of this has happened so that what the prophets have written would come true.” Then all the disciples abandoned him and ran away.

Matthew 26:59-60 GW

The chief priests and the whole council were searching for false testimony to use against Jesus in order to execute him. But they did not find any, although many came forward with false testimony. At last two men came forward.

Matthew 26:63 GW

But Jesus was silent. Then the chief priest said to him, “Swear an oath in front of the living God and tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of God?”

Matthew 27:14 GW

But Jesus said absolutely nothing to him in reply, so the governor was very surprised.

Matthew 27:15-26 GW

15 At every Passover festival the governor would free one prisoner whom the crowd wanted. At that time there was a well-known prisoner by the name of Barabbas. So when the people gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which man do you want me to free for you? Do you want me to free Barabbas or Jesus, who is called Christ?”

18 Pilate knew that they had handed Jesus over to him because they were jealous. While Pilate was judging the case, his wife sent him a message. It said, “Leave that innocent man alone. I’ve been very upset today because of a dream I had about him.” But the chief priests and leaders persuaded the crowd to ask for the release of Barabbas and the execution of Jesus.

21 The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to free for you?” They said, “Barabbas.” Pilate asked them, “Then what should I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?” “He should be crucified!” they all said. Pilate asked, “Why? What has he done wrong?” But they began to shout loudly, “He should be crucified!”

24 Pilate saw that he was not getting anywhere. Instead, a riot was breaking out. So Pilate took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. He said, “I won’t be guilty of killing this man. Do what you want!” All the people answered, “The responsibility for killing him will rest on us and our children.” Then Pilate freed Barabbas for the people. But he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified.

**What purpose did Jesus’ pain serve?**

Jesus took the penalty of our sin so we could be free. He is the champion over sin and death.

[Matthew 27:50-53](https://my.bible.com/bible/70/MAT.27.GW)[ GW](https://my.bible.com/versions/70)

### 50 Then Jesus loudly cried out once again and gave up his life. 51 Suddenly, the curtain in the temple was split in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split open. 52 The tombs were opened, and the bodies of many holy people who had died came back to life. 53 They came out of the tombs after he had come back to life, and they went into the holy city where they appeared to many people.

**The death of Jesus shook the earth, how do we let it shake us?**

Many people know the story of Jesus and yet make no change in their life. If Jesus’ death for us means something then we should live like it.

Hebrews 12:1-3 GW

1 Since we are surrounded by so many examples of faith, we must get rid of everything that slows us down, especially sin that distracts us. We must run the race that lies ahead of us and never give up.

2 We must focus on Jesus, the source and goal of our faith. He saw the joy ahead of him, so he endured death on the cross and ignored the disgrace it brought him. Then he received the highest position in heaven, the one next to the throne of God. Think about Jesus, who endured opposition from sinners, so that you don’t become tired and give up. You struggle against sin, but your struggles haven’t killed you.

**What does thinking about Jesus’ suffering do for us?**
It reminds us of how much He gave for us to live.
