# Redefine Kind

**James 1:19**
My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.
## Redefine Kind

My coaching needs coaching because I fear being direct with people who need direct feedback. They need positive confrontation. I need to redefine kind. Up until now, being unkind meant causing anyone to feel bad. But I'm recognizing that being unkind means not communicating expectations or simply communicating expectations without compassion. To be kind, we need to be both honest and compassionate. We might say, "Speak the truth in love," but we can't forget that "love always hopes." We must confront with an expectation of good.

**Ephesians 4:15**
But, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ.

**Matthew 16:23**
But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."

**Luke 13:34**
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen _gathers_ her brood under _her_ wings, but you were not willing!

## When is it time to Hulk Out?

**Ephesians 4:26** - “Be angry, and do not sin”: do not let the sun go down on your wrath…” 

**John 2:15-16** - “When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple… ‘Take these things away! Do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise!’” 

**Matthew 23:27** - “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs…”

## Conclusion

- Who in my life needs my full attention rather than my quick response?
- How can I redefine what it means to be kind and truthful in my relationships?
- Are there areas in my life where my anger stems from unrealistic expectations, and how can I surrender those to God?
