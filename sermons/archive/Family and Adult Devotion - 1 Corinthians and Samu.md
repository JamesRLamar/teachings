Last week we talked about living by the Spirit, but what does it mean to be filled with the Spirit? There is a difference and the difference means everything. We talked about all the fruit of living by God’s Spirit, but there is even more if we ask God to fill us with His Spirit.

King David was the littlest of his brothers and when the time came to see which one of them was to be king, his father didn’t even send for him to be seen by the Prophet Samuel. Yet, David was known as a man after God’s own heart, not because he was a warrior, but because he was a worshipper! David didn’t just sing psalms and songs he wrote them! We sing his songs!

Acts 13:22  (NKJV)

22 And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.’

1 Samuel 16:13  (NKJV)

13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward.

2 Samuel 6:14-15 and 22

14 Then David danced before the Lord with all his might; and David was wearing a linen ephod. 15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.

22 And I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight. But as for the maidservants of whom you have spoken, by them I will be held in honor.”

ILLUSTRATION:
Get tools of varying size and danger. Axe, Machete, hammer, spade.

Each of these are tools, but could also be used as weapons. Some tools are more powerful than others. The machete might be like the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. It can be tool to cut away all the spiritual weeds in our life or it can be a weapon against the lies of the Enemy.

The axe might be like fasting. That can be a tool to help us see and know the will of God, but it might also be a weapon to cause demons to run from us. But what makes these even more powerful is who’s hands they are in.

Put the spade in the littlest child’s hand.

In her hands, this is still a very useful tool. Now pick up the Axe. How many of you get a little nervous when I entertain the idea of giving her this axe as well? You see it matters who carrying the weapon. If I’m carrying this, you might be cautious and careful around me, but I hope you trust I know how to use this properly. Yet the person who is infinitely more wise and powerful than any of us is God.

Worship and Thanksgiving are like taking these very tools and putting them in the hands of God. In other words, worship is giving our battle over to God entirely. Worship invites God to come down from heaven to earth where we are. And when that happens, the earth literally moves.

SCRIPTURES:

When King Jehoshaphat had to go into battle, he called on God and a prophet delivered a word:

“You need not fight in this battle, station yourselves, stand and see the salvation of the Lord on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out to face them for the Lord is with you (2 Chronicles 20:17)

The next day, Jehoshophat ordered the Temple worshippers to go before Israel praising God:

21 When he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who sang to the Lord and those who praised Him in holy attire, as they went out before the army and said, “Give thanks to the Lord, for His lovingkindness is everlasting.” 22 When they began singing and praising, the Lord set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; so they were routed.(2 Chronicles 20:21-22 NASV)

Acts 16:23-26  (NKJV)

23 And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely. 24 Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. 25 But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. 26 Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were loosed.

ADULTS:

Ephesians 5:18-20  (GW)

18 Don’t get drunk on wine, which leads to wild living. Instead, be filled with the Spirit 19 by reciting psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs for your own good. Sing and make music to the Lord with your hearts. 20 Always thank God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Colossians 3:16 (NKJV)

16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

Read 2 Peter 1:1-11

Read Romans 8

Read 1 Corinthians about not coming in human wisdom but in power of Spirit
