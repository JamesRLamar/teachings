I was meditating more about the fruit this morning and asking the question, What does it take to cultivate the fruit of God’s Spirit?

Our worldly and intuitive response might be: Try harder

But that is so far from the truth. Bearing the fruit of His Spirit comes from right thinking and a right perspective that’s in step with His Mind and His Spirit.

“And I say: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not accomplish the lust of the flesh…If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.”

‭‭ (Galatians)‬ ‭5‬:‭16‬, ‭25‬ ‬‬

So again I ask the question, What does it take to cultivate the fruit of God’s Spirit?

It is not: try harder
It is: **listen** well so you can **love** well.
It is: **renew** your mind so you can **rejoice** in Him.
It is: **seek** the Peacemaker so you can **find** His peace.

It is in allowing our minds to be reshaped and renewed daily that we are cutting away the dead things and making room for new life to spring forth.

Listen well today my friends!
