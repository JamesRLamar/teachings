Have you been feeling anxious, worried, or fearful lately?

Are you looking for a way to shake it off but the worry feels unshakeable?

Try starting with hope today. Remember that worry is an expectation of evil, but hope is an expectation of good. If you can visualize the good that can come today you will be well on your way to rejoicing in this day, not dreading it.

Try imagining what would happen today if every encounter was favorable and ultimately worked out for your good. Even the “bad” or annoying things are going to turn for your good. Imagine that. Imagine every single prayer you have will be answered swiftly. That is the goodness of God chasing you with excitement today.

We need to shift our thinking to see and receive the goodness of God. Pray this with me.

“Almighty God, Wonderful Counselor. I expect good things today. I repent of my broken expectations and worry which insult your omnipotence and kindness. Create in me a clean heart, free from worldly ambition and selfish reliance. Renew in me a Right Spirit and deliver me from all that distracts and burdens. I expect good things today, because your mercies are new every morning. Amen”
