**What Matters Most? (Have the group list as many things as they can)**

1. Loving God with all our heart, soul, and strength
2. Loving our spouse
3. Loving our children as our most important disciples and/or making disciples
4. Loving our Church as our family
5. Loving our neighbor as ourselves

**It’s hard to imagine a scenario when we’d have to sacrifice something on that list for another. What’s not hard to imagine is we we’d need to sacrifice what does not matter most to protect what does.**

**Equally as important as what is on the list is what is not. Let’s take a moment to list some of those things that are not most important (Have the group list as many things as they can)**

- Hobbies and sports
- Comforts and conveniences
- Vacations
- Career/Job
- Wealth
- Exercise
- TV, games and entertainment
- Social media and mindless distractions

**Now those things are not necessarily evil or even wrong. I would even argue that we have a biblical responsibility to some of those things to some degree. Yet, they are not the things which matter most and they can most certainly steal our affection and attention away from the things that do. **

**Read the story of the Rich Young Ruler Mark 10**

**Why did Jesus leave out the first Commandment?**
**Because if you keep the 1st you will not neglect the rest**

**Luke 10:38-40**

Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word. But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.

**Luke 10:41–42**

But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.

**What does excellence in the world’s eyes look like? Is that similar to what Martha was excelling at?**

**How does excellence in the world differ from excellence in God’s Kingdom? What does it mean to be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect?**

It means to be complete and content. When are are content, we don’t strive and we aren’t tempted to sacrifice what matters most for what doesn’t.

**What little thing can we do every day to keep our focus?**
