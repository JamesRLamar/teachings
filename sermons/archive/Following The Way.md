In a world where fatigue and exhaustion are the norm, the invitation to follow Jesus calls out louder than ever. 

**Matthew 11:28-30 TS2009**
"Come to Me, all you who labour and are burdened, and I shall give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and humble in heart, and you shall find rest for your beings (souls). For My yoke is gentle and My burden is light." 

If we are tired and burdened, we may have missed something crucial in the invitation to follow Jesus.

If we feel burned out, we might have missed something vital in what it means to be led by the Spirit. 

Jesus invites us to learn from Him, but if we often feel empty, there might be much more for us to learn. Or else, we need to remember, repent, and return again to our First Love.

If we lack the rest that Jesus promised, we should question the assumptions that led us to where we are. Only once we've restored our cadence with the Spirit and His resilient rhythms of rest can we hope to lead others. Why would people want to follow us unless our lives reflected His peace in the storm?

The greatest spiritual danger of our time is not that we will reject the faith; it is that we will become so well distracted by daily life that we will settle for a lukewarm faith. A faith that compels no change from old to new. A faith that produces no reward, now or in eternity. A faith that is as dead as a body without a soul. Beware of faith that demands nothing, transforms nothing, does nothing.

Let's go learn from Jesus

Jesus never hurried and He never worried. Jesus ignored the Urgent category of decision making entirely.

**Luke 5:16**
So He Himself _often_ withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.

**Mark 4:37-38**
And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?”

**Luke 10:38-42**
Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and heard His word. 

But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, "Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me."

And Jesus answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her."

**Matthew 6:25**
Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?

**Matthew 6:27**
Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?

**Matthew 6:28**
So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin;

**Matthew 6:31**
Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’

**Matthew 6:34**
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day _is_ its own trouble.

**Philippians 4:6-7 TS2009**
Do not worry at all, but in every matter, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, shall guard your hearts and minds through Messiah Yeshua.
