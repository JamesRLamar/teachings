**Romans 10:13 **
For "whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."

**Is salvation given to all who call upon the Name of the Lord?**

**John 3:16**

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

**Is eternal life granted to everyone who believes in the Son of God?**

Certainly faith and trust are critical to Salvation, but works of righteousness are the evidence that such faith is genuine.

**So what does genuine faith look like? What is it made of? **

Genuine Faith is made of two parts:
1. One part Joy
2. One part Perseverance

These two ingredients are inseparable and work together to create repentance unto righteousness.

Joy begins when we hear the Gospel and actually see ourselves in it. Joy comes through understanding. When we see that we are the hopeless sinner, but we also see the Redeeming Savior has made a personal invitation to us. It is realizing we have been called and an answer awaits.

Perseverance comes through testing and difficulty. Perseverance comes from subjugation that is exclusive and complete.

**James 1**
2 My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials...

3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.

**Matthew 13**

19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the wayside.

20 But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;

21 yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.

22 Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.

23 But he who received seed on the good ground is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty

**Revelation 14:12**

Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
