**Exodus 20:1-5**

- And God spoke all these words, saying: “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
- You shall have no other gods before Me.
- You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth;
- You shall not bow down to them nor serve them.

**What is idolatry?**

Idolatry is measured by our AFFECTION and our ATTENTION. Whatever has most of our affection and attention is our God, therefore anything that replaces our affection and attention from God is an idol.

Jake with his bone is a good example. What’s more important, his family or the bone?
