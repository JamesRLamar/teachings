# Putting on Jesus
## Main point:

To teach children that how we live and act matters to God and should reflect His holy name. We will relate this lesson to the Third Commandment, "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain" (Exodus 20:7).

## Scriptures:

- **Genesis 37:3**: "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age. Also he made him a robe of many colors.""
- **Romans 13:14 ERV**: "But be like the Lord Jesus Christ, so that when people see what you do, they will see Christ. Don’t think about how to satisfy the desires of your sinful self.""
- **Romans 13:14 NKJV**: "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ...""

## The Tale of the Jesus Robe:

Once upon a time, in a small village, lived a young boy named Timmy. Timmy was a regular boy, just like you and me. One special night, an angel appeared in Timmy's dream and gave him a heavenly robe that used to be worn by Jesus, a robe like Joseph's coat of many colors. The angel said, "Timmy, this is a gift from Jesus. He wants you to wear it and represent Him wherever you go."

### Questions:

1. **How do you think Timmy felt when he received the Jesus robe?**
2. **What would you do if you were in Timmy's shoes?**

## Putting on Jesus:

When Timmy woke up, he realized he was actually wearing the Jesus robe! He felt so honored and happy. But then, he also started to think deeply. "If I'm wearing Jesus' robe, I must behave like Him," Timmy thought.

### Questions:

1. **What does it mean to 'put on Jesus' like Timmy put on the Jesus robe? (Romans 13:14)**
2. **How should we act if we are wearing Jesus' robe?**

## Taking God's Name Seriously:

Timmy knew that wearing the Jesus robe wasn't just for show. It was a responsibility. When people saw him, they should think of Jesus. This is just like the Third Commandment, which says we should not take God's name in vain but live in a way that makes His name valuable and honored (Exodus 20:7).

**Exodus 20:7 PARA**
You do not make the Name of Yahweh your God to be worthless, for Yahweh does not leave the anyone unpunished who makes His Name to meaningless.

### Questions:

1. **How does wearing Jesus' robe relate to the Third Commandment?**
2. **What happens if we make God's name worthless by not living like Him?**

## Scriptures:

- **Colossians 3:17**: "And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus..."
- **Ephesians 4:1-3**: "...I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love."

## Living Differently:

Timmy made a choice. Whenever he felt like lying, stealing, or being unkind, he remembered the heavenly robe he was wearing. He wanted to please Jesus, not just himself.

### Questions:

1. **How would Jesus feel if Timmy wore His robe and lied or stole or treated people unkindly?**
2. **What can we learn from Timmy about living a life that's different from the world around us?**

## Conclusion:

Just like Timmy, each one of us has been given a 'Jesus robe' to wear. This means living a life that pleases God and shows others who He is. Let's remember to honor God's name in how we live each day, making His name valuable and not worthless. Amen!

### Final Questions:

1. **How will you wear your 'Jesus robe' this week?**
2. **What is one thing you can do to live in a way that honors and adds value to God's name?**
