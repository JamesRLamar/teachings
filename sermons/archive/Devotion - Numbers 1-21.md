**Object lesson:  **Send kids outside for 2 minutes to spy out the land.  Kids write down any observations that they see; weather, land, what it looks like, etc.   come back inside after 5 minutes (time them), and give report of what saw.

**
**

**Just like you guys went and spied out the land, let’s read about how the children of Israel went and spied out the Promised land. **

**
**

**Take turns reading highlighted verses of the.**** Read Number 13:1-3 And Numbers 13:26-33.**

**Ask questions:**
**
**
What did the 12 spies see when they went to the land?

How did Joshua and Caleb react to what they saw?

How did the other 10 Spies react to what they saw?

**Take Away:**
**
**

All 12 spies saw the same thing, a land flowing with milk and honey and giants.  Joshua and Caleb believed that God would be with them to take the land.  They were not afraid of the giants.  The other 10 feared they would die.

How should we react when life is challenging or even scary?

**Adults**:

**Read Numbers 13: 31-33.**

Notice that the inhabitants of the land were the Nephilim. The Nephilim worshiped their demon fathers and offered their children to be burned alive as a sacrifice to Molech.

This is important to note because later God would command Israel to kill every Man, Woman and child that lived among these Nephilim tribes in the Promised Land.  Skeptics will point to that and say that the God of the OT was a genocidal maniac. These were not humans living in the promised land, but the spawn of demons.  The Nephilim were the offspring of fallen angels mating with man.
