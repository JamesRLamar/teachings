**Exodus 2:23-24 **

The people of Israel were very sad because they were slaves and they cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery was heard by God. And God listened to their crying, and God remembered his promise with their great great grandfathers and he rescued them from slavery.

**Numbers 11:1**

The people started complaining about their troubles because they were hungry for good food. God heard their complaints and worrying. He heard these things and became angry.

**Why would God become angry with them?**

**Numbers 11:2-3**

Fire from the Lord burned among the people. The fire burned some of the areas at the edge of the camp. So the people cried to Moses for help. Moses prayed and the fire stopped burning. So that place was called Burning. The people gave the place that name because the Lord caused a fire to burn in their camp.

4 The foreigners who had joined Israel began wanting other things to eat. Soon everyone in Israel started complaining **again**. The people said, “We want to eat meat!"

5 We remember the fish we ate in Egypt. That fish cost us nothing. We also had good vegetables like cucumbers, melons, chives, onions, and garlic. But now we have lost our strength. We never eat anything—only this Bread!

10 Moses heard the people complaining and worrying. People from every family were sitting by their tents and complaining. The Lord became very angry, and this made Moses very upset.

**Why was Moses angry?**

18 “Tell the people this: Make yourselves ready for tomorrow. Tomorrow you will eat meat. The Lord heard you when you cried out and said, ‘We need meat to eat! It was better for us in Egypt!’ So now the Lord will give you meat. And you will eat it. You will eat it for more than one, or two, or five, or ten, or even twenty days! You will eat that meat for a whole month until you are sick of it. This will happen to you because you complained against the Lord. **He lives among you and knows what you need, but you cried and complained to him**! You said, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’”

21 Moses said, “There are 600,000 soldiers here, and you say, ‘I will give them enough meat to eat for a whole month!’ If we were to kill all the sheep and cattle, that would still not be enough to feed this many people for a month. And if we caught all the fish in the sea, it would not be enough for them!”

23 But the Lord said to Moses, “Do not limit my power! You will see, I can do what I say I can do.”
