Have the group name the Ten Commandments

**Can you love God and not be obedient to guard the Ten Commandments?**
**
**
**What is the Greatest Commandment?**
**
**

The Greatest Commandment is a summary reminder of the first five commandments. So another way of thinking of it is that the first five commandments are how we keep the Greatest Commandment.

**
**What does it mean to honor your father and mother?**
**
**
**Does anyone know what the Last Days are?**

The Last Days refer to the moment on earth right before Yeshua comes back to judge everyone who has ever lived. We know from reading prophecies in the Bible that there will be special signs right before Judgement Day comes.

**2 Timothy 3:1-2 **(paraphrase)
But know this, in the last days before Judgment, the world will grow evil:

People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, full of selfish desire, people who speak evil about God, and will be disobedient to their parents…

That verse is called prophecy, which means God showed Paul, who wrote this verse, to see into the future. And Paul saw that right before Judgment day that people would become disobedient to their parents among other things.

**What’s so wrong about disrespecting or being disobedient to your parents?**

**Do people today think it’s a big deal if children are disobedient and disrespectful to their parents?**

**
**

**If being disobedient to parents is a sign of how evil people will be in the Last Days, then how should you act?**

**Let’s continue to read, in the Last Days people will also be…**

**2 Timothy 3:3-5 **(paraphrase)

...unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, gossips, without self-control, mean, haters of good,

traitors, stubborn, prideful, lovers of comfort rather than lovers of God,

having an appearance of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away.

**In that last verse, Paul prophesies that these kind of people will have a "appearance of godliness". What do you think that means?**

**Paul also said that these people would deny the power of God. What does that mean?**

Paul was not prophesying about the people of the world but people who will claim to know God and even have an appearance of godliness, yet they will also have all the other evil qualities he named. He also says we should turn away from these kind of people.

**Do you want to truly be godly and not just have a fake appearance of godliness?**

If you do, then you need to understand that we don't become godly by trying really hard, we become godly by spending quality time with the one who is God.

**How can we spend quality time with God? Thank about how we spend quality time with our friends or family.**
