God has called us to make disciples who are *fireproof* and *resilient* and to be such disciples ourselves

**
**
***Fireproof***- to be a disciple who will stand in the Day of Judgment

***Resilient*** - able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult situations: steadfastness, constancy, endurance

The ultimate story of being **Fireproof**

**Daniel 3:16-18**

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.”

Shadrach and the gang believed God would deliver them, but their faith did not demand that God deliver them.

**Hebrews 12:1-6 ERV**

We have all these great people around us as examples. Their lives tell us what faith means. So we, too, should run the race that is before us and never quit. We should remove from our lives anything that would slow us down and the sin that so often makes us fall. We must never stop looking to Jesus. He is the leader of our faith, and he is the one who makes our faith complete. He suffered death on a cross. But he accepted the shame of the cross as if it were nothing because of the joy he could see waiting for him. And now he is sitting at the right side of God’s throne. **Think about Jesus. **He patiently endured the angry insults that sinful people were shouting at him. **Think about him** so that you won’t get discouraged and stop trying.

**2 Corinthians 4:16-18**

Therefore we do not lose heart...For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.

**Romans 8**

5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.

6 For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

**2 Corinthians 5:10-11 ERV**

For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others...

**Proverbs 9:7-9**
He who corrects a scoffer gets **shame** for himself,
And he who rebukes a wicked man only **harms** himself.
Do not correct a scoffer, lest he **hate** you;

Rebuke a wise man, and he will **love** you.
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still **wiser**;
Teach a just man, and he will increase in **learning**.
