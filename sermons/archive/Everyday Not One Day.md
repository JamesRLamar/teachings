Everyday, Not One Day

Most of us live with the mindset that “one day,” we’ll do the things that matter. Likely on that list is walking more closely with God. The problem is that “one day” never becomes today. The truth is, one day, your earthly life will end, and Lord willing, you’ll wake up in the new heaven and earth. However, you will still be on earth, and you will still have to choose whether or not to seek God.

If you think you’ll seek God once all your worries are gone, you might be mistaken. The beauty of heaven on earth may present even more distractions, not fewer. Consider this: are you more devoted to God during vacation days? Ironically, many people find it harder to spend time with Him when they have more leisure, not less.

James 4:14 reminds us, “You do not know what tomorrow will bring.” Hebrews 3:15 urges us, “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.” The invitation to seek God is immediate, not eventual.

The danger of saying “one day” is that it may never arrive, while today—the day you do have—slips away. Waiting for life to be more manageable isn’t the answer. Ultimately, a relationship with God is a daily choice, not a future resolution. We cannot afford to wait for a “perfect” moment to prioritize Him. Isaiah 55:6 calls us to “Seek the Lord while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.”

Don’t wait for “one day”—seek Him every day. Seek Him today.
