**What does it mean to serve others? What are examples of serving others?**

**Did Jesus serve others?**

**Matthew 20:25-28 Paraphrase**

So Jesus called the followers together. He said, “You know that the rulers of the world love to use their power to control other people and make them serve them. But this should not be so among you. Whoever wants to be a leader must be a servant. Whoever wants to be first must serve others as if they were the least. Do as I do: For the Son of Man did not come to earth for people to serve him. He came to serve others and to give his life away to save many.”

**Why should we serve others and not ourselves?**

**Romans‬ ‭13:8**
Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law.

**1 Corinthians 10:24 NKJV**
“Let no one seek his own, but each one the other's well-being.“

**‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭3:1-5‬ ‭Paraphrase**

I’m warning you that in the future before Jesus returns, difficult times will come. You will know it is almost time for Jesus to return when people are lovers of themselves and are lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. These people will look godly on the outside but will never really act like Jesus. Stay away from these kind of people!

**‭‭Acts‬ ‭20:35‬ ‭NKJV‬‬**

Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.'

**‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭11:25‬ ‭NKJV‬‬**

The generous soul will be made rich, And he who waters will also be watered himself.

**‭‭Philippians‬ ‭2:3-4‬ ‭GW‬‬**

Don’t act out of selfish ambition or be conceited. Instead, humbly think of others as being better than yourselves. Don’t be concerned only about your own interests, but also be concerned about the interests of others.

**How often do you serve others?**

**How much time do you spend serving others? Praying for others? Loving others? Helping others?**
