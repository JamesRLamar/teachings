**The Man of God Guards the Commandments**

What does it mean to know God?

What is the evidence that someone knows God?

It’s as easy as 1, 2, 3…
1 John 2:3 NKJV
Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.

What are the Commandments?

Exodus 20

We learn from those verse that the Commandments were spoken by the very mouth of God and then written by the very hand of God. They were not made up by Moses, they were heard by millions of witnesses. We also learn the those Commandments have existed since the beginning of time and have been written on all men’s hearts. We learn that one day all mankind will be judged according to the moral compass that was put inside them since birth. No person will have an excuse on Judgment Day, because every person knows the righteous standard of God, The Ten Commandments.

If we know God, we keep His Commandments. The word keep means to guard.

Tell the story of having to guard the camp when a bear was on the prowl.

Proverbs 7:2
Keep my commands and live, And my law as the apple of your eye.

Proverbs 19:16 NKJV
"He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul,
But he who is careless of his ways will die.”

John 14:21 TS2009

“He who possesses My commands and guards them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I shall love him and manifest Myself to him.”

Revelation 22:14

“Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.”

But how many of us have broken one or all of these Commandments?

What is the consequence of breaking the law of the Creator and Judge of the universe?

Revelation 22:15

“But outside are dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie.”

Revelation 21:7-8

"He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”

Guarding the Commandments isn’t about being mostly a good person, or being religious, or even going to church. It’s about the first part of the verse we first read. To know God. If we spend enough time with another human we become like them. We finish each others sentences. We look like them and begin to act like them. But when someone truly meets God, they are changed in a moment. Yes, there is something to be said for continuing to walk with God, but if you’ve ever met Him then your life should prove it, because nobody meets God and walks away the same.

Is there a time in your life when you were changed by God? When you went from darkness to light?

If so, have you continued to walk with Him or have you gone your own way?

If not, are you done trying to be god of your own life?

Are you willing to admit that you have sinned and deserve eternal death?

Are you willing to trust the sacrifice of Jesus, as God’s only Son, as being enough to truly forgive you of the consequence of every sin you have ever committed?

Are you willing to trust God to be God and to walk away from all sin for the rest of your life?

Are you ready to walk with God every day of your life?

Are you ready to tell the world about your decision by being baptized in water as symbol of your dedication to God?
