The Shema - Hear, Listen, Understand and Obey God

**‭‭Deuteronomy‬ ‭6:4-9 ‭ERV**
4 Listen, people of Israel! The Lord is our God. The Lord is the only God.

5 You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.

6 Always remember these commands that I give you today.

7 Be sure to teach them to your children. Talk about these commands when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road. Talk about them when you lie down and when you get up. **‭‭**

8 Tie them on your hands and wear them on your foreheads to help you remember my teachings.

9 Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.

**Who is Israel?**

**Who is The Lord?**

**What are the Ten Commandments?**

**What’s the most important commandment?**

Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.

**How do we love God with all our Heart? Mind? Strength?**
