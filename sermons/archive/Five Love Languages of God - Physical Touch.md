1. God's love is Profoundly Physical
2. Showing God's love requires physical interaction
3. God doesn't care about the Physical

## Introduction

**Genesis 4:1**  
Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, 'I have acquired a man from the Lord.'

In this context, "knew" is a euphemism for sexual intimacy or the most personal form of relationship and connection.

**Matthew 7:23**  
And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!'

This series explores the concept of the five love languages—Physical Touch, Gifts, Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, and Quality Time—in the context of how God desires to be loved by us.

An important point I learned from the book The Five Love Languages is that we tend to show love the way we want to be loved. This can be a source of contention in marriage when one spouse demonstrates love in their language, but because the receiving spouse does not share that language, they don't "hear" that love. This can leave one person feeling unloved and the other feeling frustrated. If this pattern isn't fixed, a downward spiral can ensue.

**Did you know it's possible to love God in a way He can't "hear" you?**

**Matthew 15:7–9**
Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: 
These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me. And in vain they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.

**Even worse, did you know that it's possible to love God in such a way He receives it as hate?**

**Proverbs 28:9**
One who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.

**1 John 5:3**  
For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome.

## 1. God's Love is Profoundly Physical

**Matthew 8:2-3**  
And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, 'Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.' Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, 'I am willing; be cleansed.' Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

**Mark 5:27-29**  
When she heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment. For she said, 'If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.' Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction.

**Matthew 10:30**  
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

**John 13:23**  
Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.

**Psalm 139:13**  
For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb.

**John 1:14**  
And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

**Isaiah 53:5**  
But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed.

> The Ultimate act of love was both a gift of grace and an act of service, but it was also Profoundly Physical.

**Psalm 22**


## 2. Showing God's Love Requires Physical Interaction

**Matthew 25:35-36**  
For I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.

**Luke 7:44-47**  
Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, 'Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in. You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil. Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.'

**James 2:14–17**
What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

## 3. God Doesn’t Care About the Physical

**Matthew 15:7-9**  
Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: 'These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me. And in vain they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'

**1 Samuel 16:7**  
But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have refused him. For the Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.'
