***Family Emphasis***
**Activity:**
“Mother, may I?” or “Father, may I?”

Remind children that they have been learning the Ten Commandments that God gave to His people to follow. Before we learn about the fifth commandment tonight, we are going to play a game that has to do with this commandment. It is called “Mother, may I?” or “Father, may I?” depending on whether a woman or man is leading the game. To play this game have all children line up side by side along one wall of the room or along a line outside. You will be the “Mother” or “Father” and stand at the opposite them across the room at the other wall or 15-20 feet away from them outside. The goal is for the children to reach the place where you are. They will take turns asking permission to do things such as take two steps forward, hop 3 steps forward, take 5 giant steps, etc. by saying, “Mother, may I take 3 steps forward?” You will answer “Yes, you may”, “No, you may not”, or “No, but you may take 1 step backward” changing the direction. Children then have to obey what you say. Watch their behavior and attitudes when they are not allowed to do what they ask. What is their attitude as they obey? Do they refuse to obey? As the game progresses, occasionally make the children go backwards, sideways or even back to the beginning to delay their reaching you. When finished, talk about their responses to not getting their way. Ask how they felt and acted when they didn’t get their way. Was it easy or hard to obey “mother” or “father”? Did it change the way they felt about “mother” or the way they spoke to her? Then tell them that the commandment they are going to learn tonight has to do with this.

Give a tiny reward in their hand. Have a big reward waiting if they are obedient, but don’t tell them what it is. Tell them they can quit the game if they want by eating the tiny reward, but remind them there is something better if they win.

**Main Point:**
Obedience is better than sacrifice.

**Scriptures to read:**

I Samuel 13:5-14 GW

"The Philistines assembled to fight against Israel. They had 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen, and as many soldiers as the sand on the seashore...But Saul remained in Gilgal, and all the people who followed him trembled in fear. He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel. But Samuel had not come to Gilgal, and the troops began to scatter. Then Saul said, “Bring me the animals for the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” So he sacrificed the burnt offering. As he finished sacrificing the burnt offering, Samuel came, and Saul went to greet him. Samuel asked, “What have you done?” Saul replied, “I saw the troops were scattering. You didn’t come when you said you would and...I felt pressured into sacrificing the burnt offering.” “You did a foolish thing,” Samuel told Saul. “You didn’t follow the command of the Lord your God. If you had, the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel permanently. But now your kingdom will not last.”

1 Samuel 15:22 GW

'Then Samuel said, “Is the Lord as delighted with burnt offerings and sacrifices as he would be with your obedience? To follow instructions is better than to sacrifice. To obey is better than sacrificing the fat of rams.’

Exodus 20:12 NKJV

“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.”

"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. “Honor your father and

mother,” which is the first commandment with a promise, “That it may go well with you and

that you may enjoy long life on the earth.”
