(Begin by playing the Trust Fall game with parents and children)

**What does a game like this teach us?**

- Falling is scary
- Trusting without seeing is scary
- We can trust without seeing

**Who**** could see in that game?**

The other day, our neighbors one year old daughter was showing us how she just learned to walk. It was cute. Imagine you were outside with her watching over her as she was excitedly walking around in the front yard. And then in her excitement, she starts to run a little, but she starts running towards the concrete sidewalk.

**What do you think would happen? Why do you know that?**

If you ran over and stopped her from running, she would probably get mad at you and cry.

**Why do you think she would cry?**

**Do you think you could explain to her why you did what you did? Would she understand?**

Do you know that your parents understand much more than you. Just like you understand more than that one year old child. Your parents know more and they will protect you at times and stop you at times. And that might make you mad or sad because you won’t understand why. And your parents may not be able to explain things to you so you can see what they see, but you have to trust. Remember the Trust Fall Game? Sometimes we have to trust mom or dad without seeing.

No matter how old we get, God will always understand more than us. God sees us like you see the one year old child. And sometimes trusting God means trusting even when we don’t see or understand. But learning to trust God begins by learning to trust our mother and father.

**Deuteronomy 5:16 ERV**

You must honor your father and your mother. The Lord your God has commanded you to do this. If you follow this command, you will live a long time, and everything will go well for you in the land that the Lord your God gives you.

This is a commandment, not a suggestion, not something that doesn’t matter. You know what doesn’t matter, if I ask you do you like grapes or oranges more?

What does matter is if I tell you not to walk into a busy road with cars all around.** Why does that matter?**

This verse is one of God’s Ten Commandments and it’s very important for the same reason. If we do not obey this commandment we could get hurt, but the commandment also promises if we do obey we will have a good life.

**Who wants a good life? Who wants to get hurt?**

So when we choose to obey and respect mom and dad we are choosing a good life. When we choose not to obey and respect mom and dad we are choosing to allow our selves to get really hurt.

**What does obey mean?**
To listen and do what we are told

**What does respect mean?**
To do what we are told with a good attitude

**What does that look like if our parents ask us to clean our rooms?**

**What does it look like to obey but have a bad attitude?**

God is so much greater than our parents. Our parents will make mistakes, but God never will. Our parents help us to live a good life now, but God will give us life that lasts forever. How important is it to learn to obey God?

Learning to obey God starts by learning to obey mom and dad.

**Proverbs 3:5 ERV**
Trust the Lord completely, and don’t depend on your own knowledge.

**Proverbs 3:6 ERV**

With every step you take, think about what he wants, and he will help you go the right way.

**Proverbs 3:7 ERV**

Don’t trust in your own wisdom, but fear and respect the Lord and stay away from evil.

Fearing God means to be humble and to know our place. It doesn’t mean to be afraid.
