Holy days or holidays as we call  them now, have been celebrated for thousands of years. They are symbolic days of remembrance for peoples and nations.

**What does "holy" mean?**

Holidays are holy days and they make us distinct from other groups of people

**Do you know any Chinese or other foreign culture holy days?**

**What are the American holy days?**

- Since the first Exodus, God established holy days known as the Feasts of the Yahweh.
- These are described in Leviticus 23 and other places.
- The purpose of these holy days were to create a cadence for God's people to prepare for the days ahead and foreshadow God's plan of redemption until the Last Days
- The holy days also begin the calendar of God's people unlike any other nation or people
- The Feasts are also a sign to distinguish God's people from others, they are "holy" days

**Leviticus 23:2**
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘The **feasts** of the Lord, which you shall proclaim to be **holy convocations**, these are My **feasts**.

Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened.
