# The Spirit of Rejection

![[DALL·E 2023-12-02 08.43.36 - A haunting scene depicting a person being oppressed by a spirit of rejection, with the spirit whispering into their ears. The person is seated, lookin.png]]

## Seven Manifestations of the Spirit of Rejection

1. You feel despondent. There seems to be no words of encouragement that can be spoken over you to set you free from this feeling of rejection. 
2. You feel left out of conversations as if you are an observer, unable to interact.
3. You feel that life’s opportunities have passed you by, and it is too late to do anything about it. 
4. You feel rejected if you are not recognized for your accomplishments by those in authority. 
5. You feel the spirit of envy setting in as you begin comparing your situations with others. 
6. The orphan spirit partners with rejection and tells you that you were not given a fair chance in life. 
7. You feel the need to prove yourself while at the same time feeling you can never measure up.

## Seven Roots of Rejection

1. Neglect
2. Selfishness
3. Physical, emotional, and sexual abuse
4. Drug use
5. Repeated negative words and messages
6. Broken marriages and families
7. Rejection by authority roles


> Ultimately, rejection is able to corrupt our thinking when we esteem anyone other than God. 

> Esteem - to elevate, honor, worship or adore

%% If we esteem ourselves, our strength, our intelligence, our accomplishment, our whatever, then we will never feel secure. We will live with only brief moments of reprieve from our internal storm of discontentment as we chase comfort.

If we esteem others, the value they prescribe us, the love they lavish on us, or whatever should only be trusted from God alone, then we will never feel secure. We will live with only brief moments of reprieve from our internal storm of discontentment as we chase comfort. %%


# What Does God Say About Your Rejection Mindset?

> You are mine. Where were you when my hands formed all that is? You are my creation, the work of my hands, that is why you are worthy. Walk worthy of my handiwork.

> When others reject you, their rejection is a reflection of their own rejection of themselves not you.

**Isaiah‬ ‭41:9-10** TS2009 
You are My servant, I have chosen you and have not rejected you. Do not fear, for I am with you. Do not look around, for I am your Elohim. I shall fortify you, I shall also help you, I shall also uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness.

# The Call to Walk Worthy

![[DALL·E 2023-12-02 09.02.03 - A powerful and uplifting scene depicting a person standing confidently, radiating a sense of immense self-worth and humility. The individual is portra.png]]

**John 5**
**1-3** Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water. 

**4** For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. 

**5** Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. 

> Walking is an analogy of living. This man wasn't waiting to walk, he was waiting to live.

**John 5: 6** 
When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been in that condition a long time, He said to him, “Do you want to be made well?”

%% Jesus asked a question many of us skip over, but it's not an empty question. Living your life waiting to live can corrupt your mind. Like someone who has become more accustomed to being institutionalized than living with freedom, we must first ask ourselves, "Are we ready to embrace the unknown and surrender that which is comfortable?"

It is odd to think of an affliction as comfortable, but when it becomes so engrained in our everyday experience it becomes well known and known things offer a sense of stability.

Understand, Jesus could have easily skipped to the next part but it would have been in vain if the man was not ready to surrender the known for the unknown. Remember this man had been waiting to walk for 38 years. It's not like he had a job history or skills. In the next verse we'll see it's obvious he had no friends or family. So what was this man really waiting for now? %%

**John 5:7-8**
The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.” Jesus said to him, “Rise, take up your bed and walk.” And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked.

> When Jesus sets you free, the thing that carried you will become the thing you carry with ease.


**Ephesians 4:1** TS2009
I call upon you therefore, I the prisoner of the Master, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called

**Colossians 1:10** TS2009
To walk worthily of the Master, pleasing all, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of Elohim

**1 Thessalonians 2:12** TS2009
So that you would walk worthily of Elohim who is calling you into His own reign and esteem

> Worthy - to act suitably as one who is worthy

%% When I hear those words "walk worthy", I hear them now as if I was the lame man and what God is calling us to do is to no longer sit and wait. God is calling us to rise and walk. And when we walk, not to walk crookedly, but worthily! %%
