- **What are some things you fear?** 

- **What are you most afraid of?**

**Psalm 34:4**
I sought Yahweh, and He heard me, And delivered me from all my fears.

**Psalm 34:7**
The messenger of Yahweh encamps all around those who fear Him, And rescues them.

- **What does it mean to fear God?**


**Exodus 20:1-21**
1 And God spoke all these Words, saying:

2-3 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You have no other gods against My face.

4 You do not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of that which is in the heavens above, or which is in the earth beneath, or which is in the waters under the earth,

5-6 You do not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, Yahweh your God am a jealous God, visiting the crookedness of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing loving-commitment to thousands, to those who love Me and guard My commands.

7 You do not make the Name of Yahweh your God to be worthless, for Yahweh does not leave the one unpunished who makes His Name worthless.

8-10 Remember the Sabbath day, to set it apart. Six days you labour, and shall do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of Yahweh your God. You do not do any work – you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates.

11 For in six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart.

12 Respect your father and your mother, so that your days are grow long upon the land which Yahweh your God is giving you.

13 You do not murder.

14 You do not commit adultery.

15 You do not steal.

16 You do not bear false witness against your neighbor.

17 You do not covet anything of your neighbors

18 And all the people saw the thunders, the lightning flashes, the voice of the shophar, and the mountain smoking. And the people saw it, and they trembled and stood at a distance,

19 and said to Moses, "You speak with us and we hear, but let not God speak with us, lest we die."

20 And Moses said to the people, "Do not fear, for God has come to prove you, and in order that His fear be before you, so that you do not sin."

21 So the people stood at a distance, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where God was.



- **Worldly fear** expects harm or evil. We often call this worry.

- **Godly fear** expects freedom and good. We call this hope.



- A heart that fears God wants Him do things **for** us from a **distance**.

- The heart that reveres God wants Him do things **with** us up close and **personal**.



- **How can you show the fear of God when you're at home?**

- **How can you show the fear of God when you're at school?**

- **How can you show the fear of God when we gather as the Church?**

**Isaiah‬ ‭41:9-10**
You are My servant, I have chosen you and have not rejected you. Do not fear, for I am with you. Do not look around, for I am your God. I shall fortify you, I shall also help you, I shall also uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness.

**Psalms‬ ‭112‬:‭6‬-‭8‬‬‬**
For he is never shaken; the righteous is remembered forever. He is not afraid of an evil report. His heart is steadfast, trusting in Yahweh. His heart is upheld, he is not afraid, while he looks on his adversaries.
