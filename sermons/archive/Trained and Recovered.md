**How much of the past week or month have thoughts of worry, or anger, or fear dominated your mind so much it caused you noticeable and sustained stress?**

We all like to think we are trained, but if our thoughts dictate our emotions and especially our actions or even inaction, then we are likely not trained or not trained well.

**2 Corinthians 10:5**

Casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.

**What are the arguments of the Enemy that disturb your peace?**

**How do we make those thoughts obedient? How do we submit them?**

Sometimes we might be trained, but when the Enemy comes we aren't able to subdue him because we are simply too tired.

Being too tired can be the result of being too busy and it can also just be the result of neglect.

As the saying goes, "what you feed grows stronger". But the opposite of that is true as well, "what you don't feed eventually dies".

Being trained but tired can happen in seasons where we choose good things instead of God things. As we neglect a meaningful relationship with God, it begins to die. We won't feel the effect immediately, but we really feel the effect when testing comes. And when testing comes we feel like God abandoned us instead of the other way around.

We need to prioritize recovery. In the Spirit, recovery and training are the same activity, but the problem arises when we do spiritual looking things but in a way that doesn't really help us in times of testing.

So how do we recover and train at the same time?

**Philippians 4:6-7**

Be anxious for nothing, but through prayer and supplication with thanksgiving; let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your heart and mind in Messiah Yeshua.

**There are a few ways we can recover:**

- **Walk with Him every morning and spend more time giving thanks than asking for things**
- **Turn on worship music and put your whole heart into giving Him praise**
- **Meditate on the Scripture, don't just read it**

Doing those things will make sure we are feeding our love and admiration for God. And when the day of testing comes, if we have been faithful to do those things daily, we will have the strength to fight and win.
