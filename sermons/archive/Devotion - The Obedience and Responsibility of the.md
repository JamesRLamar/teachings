**Jimmy Tate:**
The Church has become too friendly with God.
The Biblical definition of Christianity is to "Follow Me."
"Having a relationship with God" is the Church's.
There's some Truth in the latter, but with frailty..
We ain't "equal partners" with God.
Nothing could be further from Orthodoxy!
Yet, services are geared for one to become "Friends with
God."
You really don't have to "obey a friend.
But you do with a god, and our God is the Most High!
"Serving God" is an antiquated term known little today..
Sacrifice, commitment, service, are credos of the
Kingdom.
Ravenhill would read Hebrews 11 on his knees..
But you say,
"What about Abraham..
The Bible says he was a
"Friend of God."
Abraham became a "Friend of God" by his Extreme
Obedience!
Yes, we are, in fact, "Friends of God," but never forget:
"Following Jesus" means "you do what He wants."

**Comment 1:**
"This is my commandment, that you love one
another as I have loved you. No one has
greater love than this, to lay down one's life for
one's friends. You are my friends if you do
what I command you. I do not call you servants
any longer, because the servant does not
know what the master is doing; but I have
called you friends, because I have made
known to you everything that I have heard
from my Father." - John 15:12-15. While I agree with
you in principal I don't think it's possible to
become too friendly with God.

**Comment 2:**
One can be a friend of God, a son of God, and
also obedient to God. These are not mutually
exclusive. If they are, then Jesus has some
explaining to do. I don't think so. He didn't use
the term like "Friending" someone on FB. It's a
sign of how He wants us to view ourselves
through Him. And it was Abraham's faith, not his obedience
that won him with God. He didn't obey fully
when told to leave his family. He brought along
Lot. He didn't even tell the truth to the King or
Pharaoh but acted in fear. But God wasn't
concerned with his failings He was impressed
with his loyalty. And that perfectly matches
with "I desire loyalty not sacrifice."

**Hosea 6:6**
For I desire mercy and not sacrifice,
And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

**Romans 4**

1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter? If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God. What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.

4 Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:

7 Blessed are those
    whose transgressions are forgiven,
    whose sins are covered.
    Blessed is the one
    whose sin the Lord will never count against them.

**James 2**

14 What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him?

15 If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?

17 Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

18 But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by [b]my works. 19 You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble!

20 But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” And he was called the friend of God.

24 You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.

Who is God?
Who is the Satan?
Who is the world?
Who is the Church?
Who are you in this story?

**Analogy of a chess game**

- There is a strategy of the Enemy to destroy us
- War not against flesh and blood
- The Church can be powerful
- Obedience is absolutely necessary

**Analogy of being a black belt**

- You will be tested
- You are expected to be above reproach
- Great responsibility to pass on what you know and guide others
