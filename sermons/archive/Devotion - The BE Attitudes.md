Many of us confidently assert that we keep all of God's Commandments. We don't murder. We don't commit adultery. We don't lie, cheat or steal.

But how's our attitude?

**John 14:15**
If you love Me, keep My commandments.

What does Jesus mean by, "My commandments"?

When Jesus taught, he gave no concessions or suggestions, he spoke with authority and thus His teachings are Commandments. This includes the very first teaching of the Beatitudes.

The word, "beatitude", refers to supreme blessedness. These are like the "Blessed Attitudes" and the way in which we ought to "be".

**Matthew 5:3**
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

"Poor" means distressed to the point of begging. It is connected to the next beatitude.

**Matthew 5:4**
Blessed are those who mourn,
For they shall be comforted.

"Comfort" means to reciprocate begging with consolation. It is the picture of someone weeping being drawn in for a tight embrace.

**Matthew 5:5**
Blessed are the meek,
For they shall inherit the earth.

"Meek" means gentle quietness. "Meekness toward God is that disposition of spirit in which we accept His dealings with us as good, and therefore without disputing or resisting." - BLB

To "inherit the earth", is the picture of being left at peace upon a new earth where every wicked person has been utterly removed and all that remains is a rich and peaceful land to dwell in for all eternity.

**Matthew 5:6**
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
For they shall be filled.

"Hunger" means to suffer want or to be needy.

"Thirst" means to thirst painfully.

"Filled" means to be satisfied to the brim or even to gorge oneself.

**Matthew 5:7**
Blessed are the merciful,
For they shall obtain mercy.

"Merciful" means compassion or to bring help to the wretched

**Matthew 5:8**
Blessed are the pure in heart,
For they shall see God.

"Pure" means to be purified by fire.

"See" does not merely mean to see, but to reveal something remarkable that was hidden.

**Matthew 5:9**
Blessed are the peacemakers,
For they shall be called sons of God.

"Peacemaker" comes from to words which combined mean to "exude a prosperous quietness". It does not necessarily mean to cause or force peace in disharmonious situations, but to emanate peace from within.

**Matthew 5:10**
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake,
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

"Persecuted" means to be troubled, harassed, mistreated, or pursued in a hostile manner

"Righteous" is used many times, but the full meaning of the word is rich. It means "integrity, purity of life, correctness of thinking feeling"

It more broadly means, "state of a man who is as he ought to be"

**Matthew 5:11**

Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.

"Revile" means to take blessings given to you, chew them up, and spit them back at the person who gave them to you.

**Matthew 5:12**

Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

"Rejoice" means to smile as you wave goodbye. The clue to understanding this phrasing is found in Psalm 37, which we will read shortly.

"Exceedingly glad" means what we think of the more commonly used word, "rejoice", which means to jump up and down and spin with excitement.

**Read Psalm 37**

Meekness is not weakness
But being nice can be a vice

**Ephesians 4:15**

but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ
