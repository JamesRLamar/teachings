**1 Peter 3:21**
There is also an antitype which now saves us—baptism...

**Daniel 4:13**
I saw in the visions of my head while on my bed, and there was a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven. 

**Daniel 4:17**
This decision is by the decree of the watchers,
And the sentence by the word of the holy ones,
In order that the living may know
That the Most High rules in the kingdom of men,

**Jude 14–15**
Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."

**2 Peter 2:4–5**
For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; 

**1 Peter 3:18–22**
18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison, 

20 who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water. 

21 There is also an antitype which now saves us—baptism (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him.

**1 Peter 4**
3 For we have spent enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles—when we walked in lewdness, lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries. 

**1 Peter 4**
5 They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
 
**Revelation 14:9-11**

> Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.”


**1 Enoch 20**
1 I traveled to where it was chaotic. And there I saw a terrible thing; I saw neither heaven above, nor firmly founded earth, but a chaotic and terrible place. And there I saw seven of the stars of heaven, bound and cast in it together, like great mountains, and burning in fire.

4 Then I said, “For what reason have they been bound, and for what reason have they been cast here?”

5 Then Uriel said to me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and he was their leader, he said to me “Enoch, why do you inquire, and why are you eager for the truth? 

6 These are **of the number** of the stars of heaven that transgressed the command of the Lord; they have been bound here until ten thousand years are fulfilled—the time of their sins.

7 From there I traveled to another place, more terrible than this one. And I saw terrible things—a great fire burning and flaming there. And the place had a narrow cleft (extending) to the abyss, full of great pillars of fire, born downward. Neither the measure nor the size was I able to see or to estimate.

8 Then I said, “How terrible is this place and fearful to behold.” Then Uriel answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said to me, “Enoch, why are you frightened so and shaken?” And I replied, “Because of this terrible place and because of the fearful sight.”

10 And he said, “This place is a prison for the angels. Here they will be confined forever.”
