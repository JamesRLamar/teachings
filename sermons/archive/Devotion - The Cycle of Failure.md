Most fear or frustration begins with unmet expectations, which are usually unrealistic or uncommunincated.

**Here's how the cycle might work:**
1. I have unrealistic expectations of myself
2. I don't meet those expectations
3. I feel a sense of failure

4. I search for a reason for that feeling that negatively reinforces the feeling of failure

5. I strive to quench the feeling of failure by all manner of unhealthy means

The root of this cycle can go unnoticed for years while experiencing broken and impulsive urges over and over again which lead to unhealthy results.

**1 - Unrealistic expectations**

**2 - Unmet expectations**

**3 - Feeling of Failure**

**4 - Negative Thoughts**

**5 - Chasing Feelings**

**Deuteronomy 30:15-16**

“See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil, in that I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, that you may live and multiply; and the Lord your God will bless you in the land which you go to possess.

**Deuteronomy 30:17**

But if your heart turns away so that you do not hear, and are drawn away, and worship other gods and serve them,

**Deuteronomy 30:18**

I announce to you today that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to go in and possess.

**Deuteronomy 30:19**

I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live;

**Deuteronomy 30:20**

that you may love the Lord your God, that you may obey His voice, and that you may cling to Him, for He is your life and the length of your days; and that you may dwell in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them.”

**Romans 4:16-17a GW**

Therefore, the promise is based on faith so that it can be a gift. Consequently, the promise is guaranteed for every descendant, not only for those who are descendants by obeying Moses’ Teachings but also for those who are descendants by believing as Abraham did. He is the father of all of us, as Scripture says: “I have made you a father of many nations.”

**Romans 4:17b NKJV**

God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did.

**Romans 4:18**

Who, *contrary* to hope, in hope believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, “So shall your descendants be.”

**Romans 4:19**

And not being weak in faith, he did not *consider* his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.

*Consider* - means to fix one's eyes upon. Abraham knew his body was not able to make children or Sarah's, but he chose not to fix his eyes upon the problem or impossibility of God's Promise.

**Romans 4:20-22**

He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, and being *fully convinced* that what He had promised He was also able to perform. And therefore “it was accounted to him for righteousness.”

*Fully convinced* - means to have full proof, to lack no evidence.

Two principles to remember:
1. Choose Life - life only comes from life
2. Speak Life - Call those things that are not as though they were

**Romans 8:6**

For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

**Psalm 103**
