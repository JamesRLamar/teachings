## Put First Things First

> Urgent? Important?

**Matthew 6:33**
But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

**Jeremiah 29:13**
And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.

**Matthew 6:21**
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

It can be argued that the greatest treasure any of have, rich or poor, is our time. How we spend our time is how we spend our greatest treasure. Habits are the ways in which we consistently spend our time. So it might be said that "Where your habits are there your heart will be also."

**Ephesians 5:15-16 NKJV**
See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

**Ephesians 5:15-16 TS2009**
See then that you walk exactly, not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are wicked.

Circumspect or Exactly - see in all directions, perfect, diligently, accurately

Fool or Unwise - asophos

Redeem - to buy back

Evil or Wicked - full of labour, annoyances, hardships, pressed and harassed by work

## Sharpen the Saw

> Don't work hard, work smart.

### What were the habits of those who walked with God?

**Daniel 6:10**
Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home. And in his upper room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his knees three times that day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as was his **custom** since early days.

**Psalms 1:‭1-2**
Blessed is the man
Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,
Nor stands in the path of sinners,
Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;
But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
And in His law he meditates day and night.

**Psalms‬ ‭63:1, 6**
Oh God, You are my God; Early will I seek You; My soul thirsts for You. I remember you while lying on my bed. I think about you in the middle of the night.

This Psalm was written when David was in the wilderness running for his life. This was not a convenient time in his life yet he kept God first by seeking Him first.

**Luke 4:16**
So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His **custom** was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.

**Luke 5:16**
So He Himself **often** withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.

## Begin With the End in Mind

> Know your destination so you can map your course.

**Proverbs 4:25-27**
Let your eyes look straight ahead, and your eyelids look right before you. Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.

**Hebrews 12:1-2** 
Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

**2 Corinthians 4:18**
While we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.


How do we measure our lives to know whether we are redeeming the moments God has given us?

Once we can envision where we ought to be, the End, how do we get from here to there?

What habits do we see from those who walked with God?

What changes should we make to put our treasure in God and seek Him first?
