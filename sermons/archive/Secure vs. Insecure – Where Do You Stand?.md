## 1. What is Security? What is Insecurity?

- **Security** = Confidence in who we are in Christ, trusting God’s plan, and living from a place of peace.
- **Insecurity** = Fear of failure, comparison, needing approval, and self-doubt.

> **Galatians 1:10 (NKJV)** – “For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.”

## 2. Signs of a Secure Man vs. an Insecure Man

### A Secure Man:

✅ Knows his worth in Christ

✅ Is not driven by fear or the need for approval

✅ Can celebrate others' success without comparison

> Philippians 2:3 (NKJV) – “Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.”

✅ Leads with humility and strength

> 1 Corinthians 16:13-14 (NKJV) – “Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong. Let all that you do be done with love.”

### An Insecure Man:

❌ Seeks validation from others

> John 12:43 (NKJV) – “For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.”

❌ Struggles with jealousy or comparison

> James 3:16 (NKJV) – “For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there.”

❌ Is easily offended or defensive

> Proverbs 29:25 (NKJV) – “The fear of man brings a snare, But whoever trusts in the Lord shall be safe.”

❌ Hesitates to step into leadership or responsibility

> Exodus 4:10-12 (NKJV) – “Then Moses said to the Lord, ‘O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; but I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.’ So the Lord said to him, ‘Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? Have not I, the Lord? Now therefore, go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall say.’”

## 3. The Root of Insecurity – Where Does It Come From?

- **Wounds from the past** – Words spoken over us, rejection, failures.

- **Comparison culture** – Social media and society make us feel “not enough.”

> 2 Corinthians 10:12 (NKJV) – “For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.”

- **Trusting self instead of God** – Relying on our strength leads to insecurity.

> Jeremiah 17:5-8 (NKJV) – “Thus says the Lord: ‘Cursed is the man who trusts in man And makes flesh his strength, Whose heart departs from the Lord. For he shall be like a shrub in the desert, And shall not see when good comes, But shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, In a salt land which is not inhabited. Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, And whose hope is the Lord. For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, Which spreads out its roots by the river, And will not fear when heat comes; But its leaf will be green, And will not be anxious in the year of drought, Nor will cease from yielding fruit.’”
