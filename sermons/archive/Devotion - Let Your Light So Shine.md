**Matthew 5:16**

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.

**1 Peter 3:14-15**

But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.” But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;

What is the hope you have? Why do you expect good even in difficult times?

**Hebrews 13:6**
So we may boldly say:
The Lord is my helper;
I will not fear.
What can man do to me?
