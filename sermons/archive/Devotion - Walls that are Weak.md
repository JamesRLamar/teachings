This week, senior pastor of Hillsong Church, Brian Houston resigned amidst mounting allegations of misconduct. Houston had already temporarily stepped down as it came to light that he covered up an accusation against his father, the founder of Hillsong, in 70's. His father was accused sexually molesting a boy in the church. This week, two accounts of sexual misconduct were also made against Brian.

The first incident occurred "approximately a decade ago" according to the church and involved inappropriate text messages from Pastor Brian to a member of staff. Hillsong claimed that at the time of the incident Houston was "under the influence of sleeping tablets" and that he apologized. The church claims, "We also worked closely with Pastor Brian to ensure he received professional help to eliminate his dependency on this medication, and this was achieved successfully."

According to Hillsong's Global Board the second complaint was received in 2019 when Houston entered a woman's hotel room after a Hillsong conference. "It was found that Pastor Brian became disoriented after a session at the Hillsong Conference, following the consumption of anti-anxiety medication beyond the prescribed dose, mixed with alcohol. This resulted in him knocking on the door of a hotel room that was not his, entering this room and spending time with the female occupant," the church said.

"Although all parts of the complaint were unable to be sustained, important elements of the complaint were sustained and the conduct was of serious concern," the statement continued. The truth is we don't know what happened next. The woman has not said there was any sexual activity. Brian has said there was no sexual activity, but he was in the room for 40 minutes."

On Nov. 4, 2020, Carl Lentz was fired from Hillsong for “leadership issues and breaches of trust,” along with “moral failures” that the church said “would not be appropriate” to go into detail about. Congregants alleged Lentz was having several affairs, and on May 31, 2021, Lentz’s former nanny accused him of sexual abuse, manipulation, and bullying.

Per Vanity Fair, Lentz grew up in Virginia Beach and met Hillsong founder Brian Houston while attending Australia’s Hillsong College, where he befriended Houston’s son Joel. Lentz was known for being a “brash and discursive presence” in class, and he and Joel bonded over their love of sports and partying; Lentz also grew close to Brian after interning for him. In 2009, Joel pitched the idea of him and Lentz opening a Hillsong branch in New York together, which they did in 2010.

The church built up a cult-like following, particularly after Bieber announced that he was “rededicating his life to Christ” because of Lentz. Lentz’s appearance — including tattoos, a Saint Laurent leather jacket, and a Rolex — made Christianity feel modern, and his sermons sounded more like self-help talks than religious lectures. The church marketed itself as both a lifestyle and a brand, and front row seats reserved for celebrities created a culture of exclusivity and coolness.

Since all these recent allegations and accusations, Hillsong pastors from around the world are resigning stating that they cannot grow a church under the shadow of this kind of falling out.

What do these tragic examples teach us about the Church?

What do they teach us about ourselves?

The same truth can be learned for both, "Their Walls are Weak"

Ironically, part of the answer for a Church with weak walls is to be a church without walls.

What walls might we need in our own life to protect us from temptation?

**Galatians 6:1-5**

1 Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted.

2 Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

3 For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

4 But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

5 For each one shall bear his own load.

**Ezekiel 8**

**Nehemiah 8**
