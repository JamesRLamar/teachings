Exodus 20
1 And Elohim spoke all these Words, saying

2 I am IAM (Yahweh) your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

3 You have no other mighty ones against My face

mighty ones (Elohim) - ruler or judge

against (al) - above or first, but it also means beside, between, coming in contact with

My face (panim) - in front of, in the presence of, in full view


Exodus 20
18 And all the people saw the thunders, the lightning flashes, the voice of the shophar, and the mountain smoking. And the people saw it, and they trembled and stood at a distance

19 and said to Moses, “You speak with us and we hear, but let not Elohim speak with us, lest we die.”

20 And Moses said to the people, “Do not fear, for Elohim has come to prove you, and in order that His fear be before you, so that you do not sin.”

21 So the people stood at a distance, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where Elohim was.

God's Commandments are preceded by a warning to be holy and concluded with an invitation to intimacy.

Cultural ideologies and values are perhaps the most seductive, because they are broadly accepted and rejecting them is commonly concerning.

When families prioritize anything over spiritual community or spiritual devotion, it reflects an adoption of a cultural shift where leisure or personal interests take precedence over spiritual commitments and devotion to One God. This reflects a larger cultural trend towards secularism or valuing personal and immediate gratification over spiritual discipline and community.
