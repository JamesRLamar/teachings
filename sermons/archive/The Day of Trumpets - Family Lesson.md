Holy days help us to remember
Holy days help to prepare us for the test to come

**How many of you know that showing up for the first day of school is important?**

Now imagine that on the first day of school the teacher told you that in 7 months you would have the most important test of the year.  All your assignments will be turned in, whether they were finished or not. And then everything would be graded. Now imagine that your teacher added that if you passed you would graduate school completely, but if you failed, you would be kicked out of school.

**Would you be careful to prepare for that day?**

**What would you do as you got closer and closer to that day?**

Well, God has given us a very important calendar. And He has told us ahead of time about all the important things He is going to do. That calendar began with the first Passover, which is something we call a Feast or a Holy Day or holiday as some call it.

**Do you know what a holiday is?**

If I told you something really important was going to happen on a holiday that is holly, jolly and full of good cheer, what day would I be talking about?

Go back to the analogy of the teacher and the final test, what if that teacher told you that your test would happen on a day that's all about Independence, freedom, and fireworks, what day do you think they would be talking about?

The Feast of Trumpets is one of God's holidays or holy days. 

**What does the word holy mean?**

The Feast of Trumpets is like other holidays because it reminds us of something that happened, but God's holy days are even more special because they also warn us of things to come. And the Feast of Trumpets is a warning about the final test all mankind will face one day. One day we will all be judged. 

**How do you think we will be judged?**

We won't be judged by how we look on the outside, or by how smart we are, or by how strong or cool we are. We will be judged by what's found in our hearts. Children, the Day of Trumpets happens every year, but one day will be the last time the Day of Trumpets ever happens. On that Last Day, Yeshua will come back and break open the sky. When He comes back, His appearance will be so bright and loud that all the earth will see it at the same time. And when He comes He will raise the dead and together with us who are alive, He will judge all mankind. So we better be ready. 

**1 Thessalonians 4:16:** "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first."

**1 Thessalonians 4:17:** "Then we who are alive _and_ remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord."

God helps to warn everyone and prepare them on the Day of Trumpets when we blow the trumpets in different ways. Just like there are bright and loud fireworks on the 4th of July, we blow trumpets. 

**What is a perfect grade in school?**

On the Feast of Trumpets, God's people blow the trumpet really loud 100 times. 100 is a meaningful number. 100 symbolizes complete perfection.

There are four ways the trumpet is blown those 100 times:
1. Wake up! (short annoying blasts)
2. Break your heart and repent! (three short descending and broken blasts)
3. Rise from the dead! (nine very short alarming blasts)
4. The hour has come, judgment is now! (one long siren sounding blast)

Today we will have you decorate these trumpet piñatas. And packed inside these piñatas are some special goodies. 

**How many of you want to find out what's inside?**

This coming Friday night, The Feast of Trumpets could begin, but we don't know exactly when, because we have to look up to the sky and watch.

**Does anyone know what we are watching for?**

The moon appears and then disappears every month. The Feast of Trumpets starts at the exact moment that the moon first appears for the 7th time on God's calendar, so the 7th month. And you can begin watching for the moon starting this Friday night! But you may have to keep watching, because you may not see the moon Friday night or even Saturday night. No one knows the exact day or hour it will come. But when you do see the moon, you have to run to your parents and tell them you saw it and you have to bring them outside to show them. And when you do you get to bust open your trumpet piñatas and find out what's inside!

The Day of Trumpets is about looking inside your heart and if there is anything ugly or sinful in there you must ask God to forgive you of your sins and clean your heart. So that when He comes to judge, He won't see any of those sinful ugly things. 

The Feast of Passover is a reminder of the sacrifice of Yeshua when He died on the cross because of your sin. When we celebrate Passover we remember what He did for us so that we could be forgiven and clean in our hearts.

Psalm 51:10
"Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me."

**What does it mean to have a clean heart towards God?**


**Conclusion:**

This coming weekend, on the Feast of Trumpets, we don't know for sure, but we know that Yeshua could come back and judge the earth. So we need to be asking God to forgive us and make us clean in our hearts.

ACTIVITY:

Have the children construct trumpets piñatas and decorate them so when they go outside to look for the moon they can bust open the piñatas and blow the trumpet found inside (along with candy)
