**Principles to live by:**
1. Live your life unto Him
2. Lead your family well
3. ***Love your neighbors intentionally ***
4. ***Listen to your calling***

Reminder of the Four Pillars of the New Testament Church
1. Apostles Teaching (Sound doctrine)
2. Loving Fellowship (centered around meals, Passover, and the Sabbath)
3. Prayer and Worship
4. Radical Generosity

**Hebrews 10:24-25**

And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.

**What part does the gathering have in our life?**

- The gathering is an important part of our commitment to each other, to Him and to guarding the Sabbath
- The gathering is an excellent next step for people we are invested in who want to go deeper
- The gathering is not an exclusive evangelism tool
- The gathering is not a checkbox for religious comfort

**Who are you intentionally praying for and investing in? **This becomes easier to answer if you are shepherding a church, but not all are called to be shepherds

**How are you investing in others (believers and non-believers)?**

**What is your gifting?**

This can include the gifts of the Spirit or the calling of being a gift from the Spirit ( A.P.E.S.T. )

The differences between the two:

- The gifts are given to individuals in the Body, the calling makes one a gift to the Body
- The gifts are momentary, the calling is permanent
- The gifts are sought, the calling is obeyed

**What do we need to do to help prepare you to walk in your gifting?**

**Look back at the Four Pillars and ask, how am I devoting myself to these things?**
