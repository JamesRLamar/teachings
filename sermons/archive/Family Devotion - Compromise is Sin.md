**Main Point:**
Compromise is sin. Small sin leads to BIG SIN.

**When you and a friend both want a cookie, but there is only one cookie left. What's a good compromise?**

**
**

**When you tell half of the truth, is that a good compromise or a bad compromise?**

**
**

**Remember the two glasses? How much poop has to be in a glass before it's just poopy water?**

When we compromise in a sinful way we are still fully sinning.

**Judges 1:28**

And it came to pass, when Israel was strong and rich, that they taxed the evil nation of Canaan, but they did not completely drive them out of their home land.

This means that when Isreal was doing very well they made the evil Canaanites pay taxes instead of making them leave like God commanded. This is a small compromise that leads to bigger compromises.

**Judges 2:10**

When the generation that knew Joshua and Moses had died, another generation arose after them who did not know God nor the work which He had done for Israel.

Because of compromise, Israel eventually forgot who God was completely.

**Judges 2:11-12**

Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they served demons; and they left God, who had saved them from Egypt; and they followed the other gods of the evil people who were all around them, and they worshipped them; and they provoked God to anger.

Israel went from small compromise, to forgetting God, to serving demons.

**Why is it important to protect ourselves from even the smallest compromise?**

**Philippians 2:15**

For then you will be seen as **innocent** and **pure** children of God, even though you live in a wicked and perverted world. For compared to them you will look like shining lights in the universe.

**Does anyone remember what the word pure or innocent means? Remember the two glasses of water?**
