**Exodus 20:14**
You do not commit adultery.

It's true that the 7th Commandment speaks about adultery, which is specifically extramarital relations when married or with someone who is married. Why are all the laws regarding sexual immorality still relevant as part of the New Covenant?

**Acts 15:28-29**
For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well.

**Married Adults**
- bond well and bond often
- be quick to forgive
- seek third-party wisdom
- have difficult conversations often so you won't have to have difficult conversations very often
- talk about temptations and be willing to offend other relationships to preserve the most important one

**1 Corinthians 12:23**
And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty

**Preface to Parents**

Even if you have done all you can to educate and protect your children, they can still be exposed to sinful and destructive behavior. If something ever happens:

**DO NOT:**

- add guilt to conviction
- parent out of fear
- pretend things will sort themselves out without intervention and conversations
- be afraid to seek professional counseling

**DO:**

- talk about things
- expect good, hope
- cast vision

**Parents to Children**

- have difficult conversations often so you won't have to have difficult conversations very often
- talk about sexuality in the context of God's design to be fruitful and multiply, normalize good sexual behavior to reduce the impact of the illicit
- talk about the body and why we cover and protect our honorable parts. It might be your body but it's God's Temple
- protect your children from unfiltered and unrestrained time with entertainment (games, tv, videos, social media)

> To look is to lust. To compromise is to sin. Lust and Compromise only lead to discontentment and dissatisfaction with what you have.

**1 Corinthians 6**
18 Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. 

19 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 

20 For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.

**Romans 13:14**
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.

**I John‬ ‭2:15-17‬ ‭**
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.

**Job 31:1**
I have made a covenant with my eyes; Why then should I look upon a young woman?

**Matthew 5:27-30**
You have heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not commit adultery." But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.

The Talmud says, "the hand that reaches below the navel shall be cut off".

**Galatians 5:19-21**
Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, **and the like**; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

**1 Thessalonians 4:3-5**
For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from sexual immorality; that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in passion of lust, like the Gentiles who do not know God
