**James 1:19**
So then, my beloved brothers, let every man be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to wrath.

**Wrath** means "anger, agitation of the soul, or impulsive"

## Questions:

- When we listen, what should we listen for? 
- Understand there are times to be angry. When is a good time to be angry? 
- What does it say when we are easily angered? 

If we are easily angered, maybe we need to listen to ourselves. We might be just as wounded as other people who test us.

**Psalm 103:8**
Yahweh is compassionate and showing grace, patient, and great in loving-commitment.

**Proverbs 14:29**
He who is patient has great understanding, but he who is short of spirit praises stupidity.

**Short of spirit** refers to someone who is impulsive or lacks the Spirit.

## Patience:

- Patience is not an emotion or special state we conjure up
- Patience is a perspective
- Patience is gained by seeking first to understand, then to be understood
