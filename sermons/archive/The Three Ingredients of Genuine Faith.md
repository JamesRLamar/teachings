Does Salvation come to all who call upon the Name of Jesus?

Does every soul that believes in the Son of God evade the infernal and receive life eternal?

Certainly faith and trust are critical to Salvation, but works are the evidence that such faith is genuine or repentant.

So what does genuine faith look like? What is it made of?

Genuine Faith is made of three parts:
1. One part Desperation
2. One part Realization
3. One part Subjugation

These three ingredients are inseparable and work together to create repentance unto righteousness through the washing and regeneration of the invited Holy Spirit into our being.

Desperation starts with one being wholly discontent with the state of our life and convinced we can make no real affect by our own. This is a sense of powerlessness to change our broken condition nor the consequences that follow.

Desperation works together with Realization. Part of realization is the desperation we feel when we recognize our incapacity to save ourselves.

Realization starts when we hear the Gospel and actually see ourselves in it. When we see that we are the hopeless sinner, but we also see the Redeeming Savior has made a personal invitation to us. It is realizing we have been called and an answer awaits. It is also the realization that He is the only path, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

Realization works with Subjugation because realization highlights that there is only one good choice to be made, to subjugate ourselves before Almighty God and to trust wholeheartedly in Him.

Subjugation comes only once weâ€™ve abandoned all others options and excommunicated all other voices. Subjugation to God is a singular, exclusive, and eternal surrender to Love incarnate. It is relived and revived everyday and every moment of the day. It is a continual recasting of the Messiah within our Temple. We put on the Lord and make no provision for the flesh.
