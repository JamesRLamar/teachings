1. **Is the baptism of the Spirit distinct from salvation?**

2. **Is there a difference between being filled with the Spirit, baptized in the Spirit, receiving the Spirit, or having the Spirit come upon us?**

3. **Can we be baptized more than once? Is it permanent?**
4. **How do we receive this?**

5. **What is the evidence of being baptized in the Spirit? What happens when we are baptized?**

6. **Is there a different measure of the Spirit?**

Some say that receiving and being baptized in the Spirit are one and the same with initial salvation. They say that Acts 2 was descriptive not prescriptive. They also claim that the spirit is a seal of salvation which cannot be broken. These claims are based mainly on two verses.

**1 Corinthians 12:13 (1, 4)**

**For by one Spirit **we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink **into one Spirit.**

**Ephesians 1:13-14 (1, 4)**

In Him you also trusted, **after you heard the word of truth**, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.

However, let us continue to read more context regarding the baptism of the Spirit and see if Acts 2 was unique.

**Deuteronomy 34:9 (2, 4)**

Now Joshua the son of Nun was **full of the spirit** of wisdom, for **Moses had laid his hands on him**

**Ezekiel 37:1 (2)**

The **hand of the Lord came upon me** and brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord

**Micah 3:8 (2)**

But truly I am **full of power by the Spirit** of the Lord, And of justice and might, To declare to Jacob his transgression And to Israel his sin.

**John 7:38-39 (1)**

He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

**Acts 1:8 (2, 5)**

But you **shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you**; and you shall be witnesses to Me…

**Acts 2:38 (1, 2, 4)**

Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

**Acts 6:3 (2, 3, 5)**

Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business

**Acts 8:14-17 (1, 2, 4)**

Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit. For as yet He had fallen upon none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

**Acts 9:17-18 (1, 4)**

And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” Immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was baptized.

**Acts 10:44-47 (1, 4, 5)**

While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word. And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?

**Acts 19:1-5 (1, 2, 4, 5)**

And it happened, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper regions, came to Ephesus. And finding some disciples he said to them, “Did you **receive the Holy Spirit** when you believed?” So they said to him, “We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.” And he said to them, “Into what then were you baptized?” So they said, “Into John’s baptism.” Then Paul said, “John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.” When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the **Holy Spirit came upon them**, and **they spoke with tongues and prophesied**.

**Romans 8:15 (2, 5)**

For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.”

**1 Corinthians 2:12 (2, 5)**

Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God.

**Galatians 3:2 (4)**

This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
