**Have the children recall the first five Commandments per the last weeks discussions. Remind them that the Shema is a summary of all the Commandments, but especially the first five. The first five Commandments are detailed Commandments regarding “how” we keep the Shema.**

Mark 12

28 Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, “Which is the first commandment of all?”

29 Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30 And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment. 31 And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”

32 So the scribe said to Him, “Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He. 33 And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, [m]with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”

34 Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”

But after that no one dared question Him.

**If the Shema summarizes the first five Commandments, then this second “Great Commandment” summarizes the last five Commandments, “Love your neighbor as yourself”. It is universally understood and is also known as the Golden Rule, “Do to others as you would have others do to you."**

Matthew 7:12

Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

**What are ways we love ourselves?**

**Write these down on one side of the board. You will notice almost all self-love actions lead to three end results:**

1. **Be healthy**
2. **Be happy**
3. **Be godly**

**On the other side, translate how those actions can be applied towards others in fulfilling the second Great Commandment. Examples should be:**

- **Help others when they are sick**
- **Be kind and forgive others**
- **Live like Jesus and tell people about Him**

**Make it a point to explain how it is no good to tell people about Jesus if we are not healthy (at least in our hearts), happy and godly.**
