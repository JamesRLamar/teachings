The word “shema”, means to hear, listen, understand and obey. The Shema was recited at the beginning every spiritual gathering for 1,000 years before Jesus. It was also written on tiny tablets that were wrapped around people’s hands and foreheads as reminders.

**‭‭Deuteronomy‬ ‭6:4-9 ‭ERV**

4 “Listen (Shema), people of Israel! The Lord is our God. The Lord is the only God.

5 You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.

6 Always remember these commands that I give you today.

7 Be sure to teach them to your children. Talk about these commands when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road. Talk about them when you lie down and when you get up. **‭‭**

8 Tie them on your hands and wear them on your foreheads to help you remember my teachings.

9 Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.

**Who is Israel?**

Israel is the people of God. It included Hebrew people and Egyptian people and anyone who wanted to worship God. Today, it also includes the Church.

**Who is The Lord?**

"The Lord", is a word used in place of God’s name, which is Yahweh. His name means I AM. And in Hebrew it actually meant I AM past, present and future. In other words, God’s name means I WAS, I AM, and I WILL BE FOREVER.

**What are the Commandments?**
1. Have no other gods but Yahweh
2. Don’t worship idols, statues or images
3. Don’t take God’s Name in vain
4. Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy
5. Honor your father and mother
6. You do not murder
7. You do not commit adultery
8. You do not steal
9. You do not lie or stand for a lie
10. You do not covet or be jealous of other people

**What’s the most important Commandment?**
The most important Commandment is also the Shema.

**Deuteronomy‬ ‭6:4-5‬ ‭NKJV**

Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.

**How do we love God with all our Heart? Mind? Strength?**
Heart is intentions, motives and emotions
Mind is our thoughts
Strength is physical and mental

Have the children repeat the Shema after you with hand signs. Repeat again while you sit down. Then again as you walk in a circle. Then again as you stand back up.
