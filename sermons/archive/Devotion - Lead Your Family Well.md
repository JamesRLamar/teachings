Our children are our most important disciples. They come first.

The call of the Shema is a responsibility that ultimately falls to the parents to teach and live well.

**Deuteronomy 6**

4 Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.

6 And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.

8 You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.

9 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

**As parents, adults, or mature believers in the Kingdom of God we have a mandate to Teach and Lead. So how do we lead and what do we teach?**

**We need to be the kind of people we would be proud to see our children become. **

**1 Corinthians 11:1 TS2009**
***Become imitators of me***, as I also am of Messiah.

**1 Corinthians 11:1 KJV**
***Be followers of me***, as I follow Christ.

God casts vision for His People. He doesn't just tell them what to do and what not to do. Look at the original reading of the Ten Commandments and notice how each Commandment casts a vision. It's not just a list of rules.

**Exodus 20**
1 And God spoke all these words, saying:

2 I am יהוה your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3 You shall have no other gods before Me.

4 You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, 6 but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.

7 You do not bring the Name of יהוה your Elohim to naught, for יהוה does not leave the one unpunished who brings His Name to naught.

8 Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

12 Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which יהוה your God is giving you.

13 You do not murder.

14 You do not commit adultery.

15 You do not steal.

16 You do not bear false witness against your neighbor.

17 You do not covet your neighbor's house, you do not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, or whatever belongs to your neighbor.

The qualities we have are the qualities we will pass on to our children. None of us are perfect, thus we must also let our children see our repentance and humility.

**Galatians 5**

19 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
