**The Man of God ****Does Not Love the World**

Mankind has always strived after living longer or even living forever.

Why is that?

Besides living forever, what do most men want?

1 John 2:15-17 NKJV

Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides(lives) forever.

Remember that verse is preceded by last week’s devotion, [Devotion - Qualities of a Man of God - Guards the Commandments](evernote:///view/10666323/s95/04fe1e86-65a1-4719-8180-3fffbac272c9/04fe1e86-65a1-4719-8180-3fffbac272c9/)

If you read Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, you will notice that the Commandment to Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength is not listed as the first Commandment. We learn that Commandments as a summary of all the Commandments. It comes with a promise “That we may live long”. It is the thing which the world desires most

Deuteronomy 6:4-5

“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.

Deuteronomy 6:6-9

“And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

On a scale of 1 to 10:
Where is your love of the world?
Where is your love for God?
