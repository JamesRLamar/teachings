title: Meaning of Passover
---



The origins of Passover go back to Israel's exodus from Egypt, but the festival's symbolism goes back to Adam. After Adam and Eve sinned, God prophesied that Adam's seed would crush the head of the serpent but that the serpent would bruise his heel. Yeshua is often called the "Son of Man," which translates to the son of Adam or the seed of Adam. The first Passover was yet another foreshadowing of Yeshua and His crucifixion.

The holy days are Yahweh's calendar, which tells the story of His redemptive plan for mankind, going back to Adam.

God has made us ambassadors of His story. The Feasts tell part of His story and the Last Supper and crucifixion of Yeshua are a major part of that story. We are commanded to proclaim that story or Gospel. Passover is one of the ways we proclaim the Gospel.

The disciples kept Passover on the day Yeshua was crucified. At that meal, Yeshua extended the symbolic meaning of the holy day to include the sacrifice He would make for us all. 

Paul taught that the Passover should be kept and regarded as holy. He claimed that many were sick or dead because they treated Passover in an unworthy way. Paul's use of the word "communion" became synonymous with Passover.

# Passover and the First Protest against the Roman Church

321: Constantine decreed, "On the venerable day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed."

325: At the Council of Nicea, Constantine said regarding the celebration of Easter, "It appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews. . . . Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd. . . . It is most fitting that all should unite . . . in avoiding all participation in the perjured conduct of the Jews."

**The Lord's Supper A.K.A. Communion**

**What is Communion, and where does the word "Communion" come from?**

**1 Corinthians 10:16-17 NKJV**

The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread.

**Luke 22:19-20 NKJV**

And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; do **this** in remembrance of Me." Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you."

**What was "this" in reference to in the verses above?**

"This" is referring to the Passover Feast

**Are we ever commanded to celebrate the resurrection?**

No

**Are we ever commanded to celebrate the Lord's death?**

Yes

**1 Corinthians 11:23-26 NKJV**

23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, "Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do **this** in remembrance of Me." In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”

26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes.

**Where did the tradition of celebrating Communion every Sunday come from?**

The Sunday tradition and weekly celebration of Communion originated in the churches of Rome and Alexandria as early as the second century. Worship of Sol or Sol Invictus was very popular in worship in the Roman Empire. Worship was generally done at sunrise on Sunday morning with prayers to the Unconquered Sun.

**Extra-biblical Citations:**

The letter below can be found in the book, The Complete Ante-Nicene Fathers

**FROM:**
Polycrates, the Bishop of Ephesus in AD 130–196

**TO:**
Victor, The Bishop of Rome

**SUMMARY:**

In his letter to the bishop in Rome, Polycrates is greatly concerned at their practice of observing Passover on Sunday. The Roman church called this Paschal Sunday or Easter Sunday. It was not patterned after any biblical example, but was being done to keep in sync with pagan worship in the area to make it more palatable for new believers.

**LETTER:**

*From His Epistle to Victor and the Roman Church Concerning the Day of Keeping the Passover.*

*As for us, then, we scrupulously observe the exact day, neither adding nor taking away. For in Asia great luminaries have gone to their rest, who shall rise again in the day of the coming of the Lord, when He cometh with glory from heaven and shall raise again all the saints.*

*I speak of Philip, one of the twelve apostles, who is laid to rest at Hierapolis; and his two daughters, who arrived at old age unmarried; his other daughter also, who passed her life under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and reposes at Ephesus; John, moreover, who reclined on the Lord’s bosom, and who became a priest wearing the mitre, and a witness and a teacher—he rests at Ephesus.*

*Then there is Polycarp, both bishop and martyr at Smyrna; and Thraseas from Eumenia, both bishop and martyr, who rests at Smyrna. Why should I speak of Sagaris, bishop, and martyr, who rests at Laodicea? of the blessed Papirius, moreover? and of Melito the eunuch, who performed all his actions under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and lies at Sardis, awaiting the visitation from heaven, when he shall rise again from the dead?*

*These all kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in accordance with the Gospel, without ever deviating from it, but keeping to the rule of faith. Moreover, I also, Polycrates, who am the least of you all, in accordance with the tradition of my relatives, some of whom I have succeeded—seven of my relatives were bishops, and I am the eighth, and my relatives always observed the day when the people put away the leaven—I myself, brethren, I say, who am sixty-five years old in the Lord, and have fallen in with the brethren in all parts of the world, and have read through all Holy Scripture, am not frightened at the things which are said to terrify us. For those who are greater than I have said, “We ought to obey God rather than men.”*

*I might also have made mention of the bishops associated with me, whom it was your own desire to have called together by me, and I called them together: whose names, if I were to write them down, would amount to a great number. These bishops, on coming to see me, unworthy as I am, signified their united approval of the letter, knowing that I wore these grey hairs not in vain, but have always regulated my conduct in obedience to the Lord Jesus.*

**What do we learn about the keeping of Passover among all the known bishops in the world except the bishop in Rome?**

**What was the practice of the church in Rome?**
**
**

**Why is it significant that it is the church in Rome that is perverting to practices of the Church?**

The church in Rome is a geographic location where John sees the whore of Babylon, A.K.A. the False or Apostate Church, arising from in Revelation 17. He sees the "woman," and she sits or resides in the city on seven hills, A.K.A. Rome.
