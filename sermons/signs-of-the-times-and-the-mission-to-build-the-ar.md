# Scoffers

There are birth pangs signs building all around us. And while it's true we have seen birth pang signs come in waves before, every subsequent wave that comes is bigger and bigger. Some people aren't even alarmed by these signs anymore because they say, as the prophets predicted, "all things continue as they were."

**2 Peter 3:3-4 KJV**
"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."

**2 Peter 3:1-8 TS2009**
1. This is now, beloved ones, the second letter I write to you, in which I stir up your sincere mind, to remember

2.  the words previously spoken by the set-apart prophets, and of the command of the Master and Saviour, spoken by your emissaries,

3. knowing this first: that mockers shall come in the last days with mocking, walking according to their own lusts,

4. and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all continues as from the beginning of creation.”

5. For they choose to have this hidden from them: that the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, by the Word of Elohim,

6. through which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.

7. And the present heavens and the earth are treasured up by the same Word, being kept for fire, to a day of judgment and destruction of wicked men.

8. But, beloved ones, let not this one matter be hidden from you: that with יהוה one day is as a thousand years, and **a thousand years as one day**.

# The Mission
Peter write his second letter as a "sincere reminder", in order to "stir up" the believers he shepherded.
