- Generosity is as much a part of following Christ as keeping the Commandments, but no specific amount is commanded
- Generosity must be cheerful not under compulsion or manipulation
- Generosity is multiplied by God
- Generosity increases our righteousness
- Generosity produces contentment through simplicity
- Generosity causes thanksgiving
- Generosity protects you from the love of the world
- Generosity sets you free from being owned by the things you own
- We have to earn the right to be generous

**2 Corinthians 9:5-11**

'Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time, and prepare your generous gift beforehand, which you had previously promised, *that it may be ready as a matter of generosity* and **not as a grudging obligation**. But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, **not grudgingly or of necessity**; for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work. As it is written: “He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.” Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness, while you are enriched in everything for all ***liberality***, which causes thanksgiving through us to God.'

The word “liberality” means simplicity. Being generous allows us to be enriched, but towards the simplicity as our end not excess.

**2 John 2:15-17**

Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.

### 1 John 3:16-18

This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.

- Being givers instead of takers is important but we must plan abd budget so we can be generous. Meaning, don’t give all your money away but then you have to borrow money to live
- Radical generosity - what does that look like?  What are examples?
- What does being a giver look like?
- Tithing is no longer the same, but the expectation to care for the poor is, but who are the poor?
