**Ask questions:**

What was Balaam’s occupation?

Was Balaam good at what he did?

Why couldn’t Balaam curse Israel?

Why did God send an angel to kill Balaam?

What ultimately got Balaam killed?

**Lessons learned from Balaam:**

- Don’t play games with God
    - Balaam already knew that God told him not to go see Balak, but he went anyway after Balak asked the second time
    - Don’t try and fool yourself or fool God after He has already made His will clear. Asking a second time doesn’t change anything
- Don’t sell out for personal gain
    - Spiritual gifts are always meant to point people to God not ourselves
- Don’t let your charisma take you farther than your character will sustain you
    - Don’t fool yourself or others by pretending. Never let you position replace your relationship with God
