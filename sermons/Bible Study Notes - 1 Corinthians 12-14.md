**1 Corinthians 12**

27 Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. 28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? 30 Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 31 But earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.

**We learn a few things from the 1 Corinthians 12 through 14: **

- There are many gifts imparted to the church through God’s Spirit
- Some of those gifts are given to people (miracles, healings, helps, administration, divine language and interpretation of divine language, and others)
- Some of those gifts *are* people (Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, Evangelists, Teachers)
- All gifts are given for the purpose of pointing people to God Himself

It is hard to say what order or priority is actually ascribed to Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers, but the Scripture does use wording to define those gifts as at least being distinct from the others. Just as Paul also says that some gifts are greater than others and that we ought to “eagerly desire the greater gifts, especially that we may prophesy.”

**Do you eagerly desire the gift of prophecy?**

I think the gifts can be scary things. They are scary because they are not understood. Imagine there lay a mystery gift at your front door and that once you open it, it remains your responsibility for life. How many would be hesitant to open that gift? It might be easier to stuff it in the basement than open it and display proudly in your living room.

You might think to yourself that spiritual gifts are weird and that you prefer to focus on what matters most, love. 1 Corinthians 13 is certainly the well known “love” chapter, but how many of us eagerly seek to embody EVERY quality of love outlined in that chapter?

**Let’s do a checklist and compare Love to our actual behavior:**

- Love does not parade itself...CHECK, I hate parades
- Love suffers long and is kind...Mostly check
- Love does not envy…Check?
- Love does not behave rudely…Check :) I’m from the south
- Love does not seek its own…Erghhh
- Love is never provoked or easily angered…Next
- Love thinks no evil…Chec…wait…"thinks"

We could go on, but I think it’s safe to say that 1 Corinthians 12, 13, and 14 may be the most neglected chapters in the Bible. Few of us can say we eagerly seek the mysterious gift of prophecy and dedicate ourselves to embodying Love Incarnate. But are these chapters optional or appropriate only for “advanced” Christians? I think not. I am challenged deeply by these chapters.

**How do we seek a gift anyway?**
1. Ask for it
2. Open it
3. Use it

**Ask for it**, this means what it says.

**Open it**, this means more about opening yourself up than the gift. Set your expectation on actually receiving the gift and then accepting the fear of the unknown and the consequence it may have on your reputation.

**Use it**, this means practically to speak, to proclaim, to do, to go, or whatever that gift may demand.

**How do we love?**

- Not by trying harder
- Not by being better
- But by being with the Father, that’s it!

God’s Presence is too awesome for us to be with Him and not be transformed by Him. So seek Him and all else will follow.
