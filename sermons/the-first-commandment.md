title: The First Commandment
---




 "You shall have no other gods before Me."  (Exodus 20:3)

 "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven."  (Matthew 7:21)

"And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever." (1 John 2:17)

Jesus didn't say, "he who knows My will." He said, "he who does My will."

The First Commandment is not a belief to be held—it's a reality to be lived. 
To accept God as God is to recognize His absolute authority. He doesn't exist for our benefit; we exist for His glory. He is not our life coach, our emergency contact, or our cosmic therapist—He is the King.

This is why idolatry is so offensive to Him. Not because He is insecure, but because false gods destroy.

Israel's greatest failure was not that they stopped worshiping God—it was that they worshiped God and other gods. They still went to the temple, still sang the psalms, still called Yahweh their Lord. But their devotion was divided.

The First Commandment calls us to undivided allegiance. No rival gods. No competing loves. No watered-down devotion.

 "No one can serve two masters." (Matthew 6:24)

To have no other gods means to stop treating God as an option and start treating Him as everything. 

### How do We Keep The First Commandment?

#### 1. Pray For The Will Of God

When Jesus taught us to pray, He didn't say, "God, please bless my plans." He said,

 "Your kingdom come. Your will be done."  (Matthew 6:10)

Our prayers reveal whose kingdom we're building.

Many acknowledge God, but few surrender to Him. This is why Jesus warned that on Judgment Day, many will call Him Lord, yet hear the terrifying words:

 "I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!"  
 (Matthew 7:23)

A person can believe in God and still be in rebellion against Him. The First Commandment demands more than belief—it compels surrender.

#### 2. Believe God Is Who He Says He Is

The First Commandment doesn't just require belief in God's existence—it requires belief in His character.

 "Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him." (Hebrews 11:6)

- Do we trust that He is good, even when life is hard?
- Do we believe His promises, even when they seem distant?
- Do we live as though He is our reward, or do we chase after lesser things?

Many say they believe in God, yet their actions betray that belief. They trust their job more than His provision. They fear man more than they fear Him. They obey when it's convenient but compromise when it costs them.

Believing that God **is** means believing He **is** enough. That He alone satisfies. That He alone is worthy of our full devotion. 

#### 3. Declare Yahweh As God For Others To See

The First Commandment isn't just about rejecting false gods—it's about making sure God has no rivals in our hearts. It's about loyalty, love, and a life that declares:

 "The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!"  (1 Kings 18:39)

There will always be other voices calling for our devotion. The world will always offer a thousand reasons to compromise. But the First Commandment stands as a line in the sand. This line should be evident to anyone who knows us. If the distinction is hard to see, maybe there isn't a distinction at all.

The challenge of this commandment is to declare Yahweh as God in all things, including your career, reputation, hobbies, friendships, in everything.

No other gods. No lesser thrones. No rival kings.

 "Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve… But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."  (Joshua 24:15)

### Reflection

- Have you drawn a line in the sand that is evident to others?
- Can you proclaim without hesitation that "as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD"?
- Do you seek God's will or just ask Him to approve your own?
