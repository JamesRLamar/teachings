---


Sometimes we view life like we do sports 1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on. It’s part of the American culture that there are winners and losers and degrees in-between. The mistake we might make as American-Christians is to think that God needs to be #1 when He really expects to be everything! God does not demand that He be #1. He doesn’t want to be the most worshipped thing in your life, He wants to be the only thing you worship. He doesn’t want most of your devotion, He wants ALL of it.

Consider the stories from this week’s reading found in 2 Samuel and Luke 14.

**2 Samuel 5:10 ESV**

And David became greater and greater, for the Lord , the God of hosts, was with him.

**2 Samuel 5:12 ESV**

And David knew that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.

Now imagine you were David. You KNEW that God was with you! You KNEW that he had established you as the head honcho of the entire country. I can imagine it would be easy to think that you could do no wrong in such circumstances, but David knew better than that. David KNEW that without the trusted council of God that he would fail at anything he put his hand to. The flip side of that was true as well. David KNEW that by trusting completely in the word of God, ultimately, he could not fail.

**2 Samuel 5:19 ESV**

And David inquired of the Lord , “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?” And the Lord said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.”

**2 Samuel 5:22-23 ESV**

And the Philistines came up yet again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. And when David inquired of the Lord , he said, “You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come against them opposite the balsam trees.

What do you notice that is different in those two verses?

Why did David even ask the second time if God would give him victory over the Philistines?

**Luke 14:25-33 ESV**

Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them, “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.

For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’ Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.

So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.

**We must carefully consider whether God really is at the center of our life.**

Is God the reason and source of everything you do?

Is there anything that competes for your attention and affection for God?

Does God ever take a back seat in your life?

What do you have left to renounce in order to be His disciple?
