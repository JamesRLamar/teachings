**Philippians 4:6–7**
6-Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 

7-and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

The word **"worry"** originates from the Old English word "wyrgan," which meant "to strangle."

The word **"anxious"** comes from the Latin word "anxius," which is derived from "angere," meaning "to choke, torment."

In the Greek, the term "anxious" expresses a division or distraction of the mind. 

**What does it mean to choose anxiety?**

**2 Corinthians 10:5**
We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

**Luke 10:41–42**
And Jesus answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.”

**Romans 6:6**
Because of this we are no longer slaves to sin.

**Romans 6:18**
And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.

**What does it mean to be a slave to righteousness?**

Peace, in Philippians, means stillness or quiet. 

Thayer defines peace in this verse as "exemption from the rage and havoc of war."

I like the idea that having God's peace makes you look like you're cheating. It makes you exempt from chaos in the midst of a storm. You simply disregard the violence, threat, and pain as Yeshua did when He stood up to rebuke the storm. "Peace, be still!"

We all know peace is a fruit of the Spirit, but a good reminder is that the fruit of the Spirit does not manifest as a result of trying harder, but there is a responsibility to submit our thoughts to Him. We choose not to allow thoughts contrary to the truth of who God is to strangle us. We do not allow "many things" to crowd and confuse our minds so that the peace of God, which ought to guard our mind, is strangled by the sheer volume of worry and desperation to control.

Peace will never come to the soul striving to do all, be all, and control all. Peace comes to the one who commands the storm to obey the master. Sometimes, that storm is just the flurry of thoughts in our minds. 

**What are the common worries or anxieties that you find most difficult to surrender to God? Why do you think that is?**

**What is the cost of worry?**
