Containment and Practiced Meditation are necessary overcome the brokenness of our childhood.

We must relive the pain and rewrite the script we told ourselves in those moments.

The script we wrote in our minds as children is what produces an almost subconscious pattern of thinking that leads us towards very unhealthy behaviors. It is easy to dismiss those behaviors as “right” or “normal” because of how ingrained the thinking is behind them.

**Proverbs 14:12 and 16:25**
There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.

**Containment Steps:**

- Identify the trigger, feelings disproportionate to reality
- Identify the script or automatic thought
- What is the evidence for this thought?
- What is the evidence against this thought?
- The contained thought or truth over fact
